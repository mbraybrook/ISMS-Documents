The\ntopic-specific policy should be communicated to all relevant personnel\nand consider the following:\n\na)  the type of information and the classification level that the user\n    endpoint devices can handle, process, store or support;\n\nb)  registration of user endpoint devices;\n\nc)  requirements for physical protection;\n\nd)  restriction of software installation (e.g. remotely controlled by\n    > system administrators);\n\ne)  requirements for user endpoint device software (including software\n    versions) and for applying updates (e.g. active automatic updating);\n\nf)  rules for connection to information services, public networks or any\n    other network off premises (e.g. requiring the use of personal\n    firewall);\n\ng)  access controls;\n\nh)  storage device encryption;\n\ni)  protection against malware;\n\nj)  remote disabling, deletion or lockout;\n\nk)  backups;\n\nl)  usage of web services and web applications;\n\nm)  end user behaviour analytics (see\n    > [[8.16]](#monitoring-activities));\n\nn)  the use of removable devices, including removable memory devices,\n    > and the possibility of disabling physical ports (e.g. USB ports);\n\no)  the use of partitioning capabilities, if supported by the user\n    > endpoint device, which can securely separate the organization\\'s\n    > information and other associated assets (e.g. software) from other\n    > information and other associated assets on the device.\n\nConsideration should be given as to whether certain information is so\nsensitive that it can only be accessed via user endpoint devices, but\nnot stored on such devices. In such cases, additional technical\nsafeguards can be required on the device. For example, ensuring that\ndownloading files for offline working is disabled and that local\nstorage such as SD card is disabled.\n\nAs far as possible, the recommendations on this control should be\nenforced through configuration management (see\n[[8.9]](#configuration-management)) or automated tools.\n\n[User responsibility]\n\nAll users should be made aware of the security requirements and\nprocedures for protecting user endpoint devices, as well as of their\nresponsibilities for implementing such security measures. Users should\nbe advised to:\n\na)  log-off active sessions and terminate services when no longer\n    needed;\n\nb)  protect user endpoint devices from unauthorized use with a physical\n    control (e.g. key lock or special locks) and logical control (e.g.\n    password access) when not in use; not leave devices carrying\n    important, sensitive or critical business information unattended;\n\nc)  use devices with special care in public places, open offices,\n    meeting places and other unprotected areas (e.g. avoid reading\n    confidential information if people can read from the back, use\n    privacy screen filters);\n\nd)  physically protect user endpoint devices against theft (e.g. in cars\n    and other forms of transport, hotel rooms, conference centres and\n    meeting places).\n\nA specific procedure taking into account legal, statutory, regulatory,\ncontractual (including insurance) and other security requirements of\nthe organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of\nuser endpoint devices.\n\n[Use of personal devices]\n\nWhere the organization allows the use of personal devices (sometimes\nknown as BYOD), in addition to the guidance given in this control, the\nfollowing should be considered:\n\na)  separation of personal and business use of the devices, including\n    using software to support such separation and protect business data\n    on a private device;\n\nb)  providing access to business information only after users have\n    acknowledged their duties (physical protection, software updating,\n    etc.), waiving ownership of business data, allowing remote wiping of\n    data by the organization in case of theft or loss of the device or\n    when no longer authorized to use the service. In such cases, PII\n    protection legislation should be considered;\n\nc)  topic-specific policies and procedures to prevent disputes\n    concerning rights to intellectual property developed on privately\n    owned equipment;\n\nd)  access to privately owned equipment (to verify the security of the\n    > machine or during an investigation), which can be prevented by\n    > legislation;\n\ne)  software licensing agreements that are such that organizations can\n    > become liable for licensing for client software on user endpoint\n    > devices owned privately by personnel or external party users.\n\n[Wireless connections]\n\nThe organization should establish procedures for:\n\na)  the configuration of wireless connections on devices (e.g. disabling\n    vulnerable protocols);\n\nb)  using wireless or wired connections with appropriate bandwidth in\n    accordance with relevant topic-specific policies (e.g. because\n    backups or software updates are needed).",
    "otherInformation": "Controls to protect information on user endpoint devices depend on\nwhether the user endpoint device is used only inside of the\norganization\\'s secured premises and network connections, or whether\nit is exposed to increased physical and network related threats\noutside of the organization.\n\nThe wireless connections for user endpoint devices are similar to\nother types of network connections but have important differences that\nshould be considered when identifying controls. In particular, back-up\nof information stored on user endpoint devices can sometimes fail\nbecause of limited network bandwidth or because user endpoint devices\nare not connected at the times when backups are scheduled.\n\nFor some USB ports, such as USB-C, disabling the USB port is not\npossible because it is used for other purposes (e.g. power delivery\nand display output).",

This should be\ndocumented in a topic-specific policy on logging.\n\nEvent logs should include for each event, as applicable:\n\na)  user IDs;\n\nb)  system activities;\n\nc)  dates, times and details of relevant events (e.g. log-on and\n    log-off);\n\nd)  device identity, system identifier and location;\n\ne)  network addresses and protocols.\n\nThe following events should be considered for logging:\n\na)  successful and rejected system access attempts;\n\nb)  successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts;\n\nc)  changes to system configuration;\n\nd)  use of privileges;\n\ne)  use of utility programs and applications;\n\nf)  files accessed and the type of access, including deletion of\n    important data files;\n\ng)  alarms raised by the access control system;\n\nh)  activation and de-activation of security systems, such as anti-virus\n    systems and intrusion detection systems;\n\ni)  creation, modification or deletion of identities;\n\nj)  transactions executed by users in applications. In some cases, the\n    applications are a service or product provided or run by a third\n    party.\n\nIt is important for all systems to have synchronized time sources (see\n[[8.17]](#clock-synchronization)) as this allows for\ncorrelation of logs between systems for analysis, alerting and\ninvestigation of an incident.\n\n[Protection of logs]\n\nUsers, including those with privileged access rights, should not have\npermission to delete or de-activate logs of their own activities. They\ncan potentially manipulate the logs on information processing\nfacilities under their direct control. Therefore, it is necessary to\nprotect and review the logs to maintain accountability for the\nprivileged users.\n\nControls should aim to protect against unauthorized changes to log\ninformation and operational problems with the logging facility\nincluding:\n\na)  alterations to the message types that are recorded;\n\nb)  log files being edited or deleted;\n\nc)  failure to record events or over-writing of past recorded events if\n    > the storage media holding a log file is exceeded.\n\nFor protection of logs, the use of the following techniques should be\nconsidered: cryptographic hashing, recording in an append-only and\nread-only file, recording in a public transparency file.\n\nSome audit logs can be required to be archived because of requirements\non data retention or requirements to collect and retain evidence (see\n[[5.28]](#collection-of-evidence)).\n\nWhere the organization needs to send system or application logs to a\nvendor to assist with debugging or troubleshooting errors, logs should\nbe de-identified where possible using data masking techniques (see\n[[8.11]](#data-masking)) for information such as\nusernames, internet protocol (IP) addresses, hostnames or organization\nname, before sending to the vendor.\n\nEvent logs can contain sensitive data and personally identifiable\ninformation.

When establishing a\nbaseline, the following should be considered:\n\na)  reviewing utilization of systems at normal and peak periods;\n\nb)  usual time of access, location of access, frequency of access for\n    each user or group of users.\n\nThe monitoring system should be configured against the established\nbaseline to identify anomalous behaviour, such as:\n\na)  unplanned termination of processes or applications;\n\nb)  activity typically associated with malware or traffic originating\n    from known malicious IP addresses or network domains (e.g. those\n    associated with botnet command and control servers);\n\nc)  known attack characteristics (e.g. denial of service and buffer\n    overflows);\n\nd)  unusual system behaviour (e.g. keystroke logging, process injection\n    and deviations in use of standard protocols);\n\ne)  bottlenecks and overloads (e.g. network queuing, latency levels and\n    network jitter);\n\nf)  unauthorized access (actual or attempted) to systems or information;\n\ng)  unauthorized scanning of business applications, systems and\n    networks;\n\nh)  successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources\n    (e.g. DNS servers, web portals and file systems);\n\ni)  unusual user and system behaviour in relation to expected behaviour.\n\nContinuous monitoring via a monitoring tool should be used. Monitoring\nshould be done in real time or in periodic intervals, subject to\norganizational need and capabilities. Monitoring tools should include\nthe ability to handle large amounts of data, adapt to a constantly\nchanging threat landscape, and allow for real-time notification. The\ntools should also be able to recognize specific signatures and data or\nnetwork or application behaviour patterns.\n\nAutomated monitoring software should be configured to generate alerts\n(e.g. via management consoles, email messages or instant messaging\nsystems) based on predefined thresholds. The alerting system should be\ntuned and trained on the organization's baseline to minimize false\npositives. Personnel should be dedicated to respond to alerts and\nshould be properly trained to accurately interpret potential\nincidents. There should be redundant systems and processes in place to\nreceive and respond to alert notifications.\n\nAbnormal events should be communicated to relevant parties in order to\nimprove the following activities: auditing, security evaluation,\nvulnerability scanning and monitoring (see\n[[5.25]](#assessment-and-decision-on-information-security-events)).\nProcedures should be in place to respond to positive indicators from\nthe monitoring system in a timely manner, in order to minimize the\neffect of adverse events (see\n[[5.26]](#response-to-information-security-incidents)) on\ninformation security.

[During\n    > coding]\n\nConsiderations during coding should include:\n\na)  secure coding practices specific to the programming languages and\n    techniques being used;\n\nb)  using secure programming techniques, such as pair programming,\n    refactoring, peer review, security iterations and test-driven\n    development;\n\nc)  using structured programming techniques;\n\nd)  documenting code and removing programming defects, which can allow\n    information security vulnerabilities to be exploited;\n\ne)  prohibiting the use of insecure design techniques (e.g. the use of\n    hard-coded passwords, unapproved code samples and unauthenticated\n    web services).\n\nTesting should be conducted during and after development (see\n[[8.29]](#security-testing-in-development-and-acceptance)).\nStatic application security testing (SAST) processes can identify\nsecurity vulnerabilities in software.\n\nBefore software is made operational, the following should be\nevaluated:\n\na)  attack surface and the principle of least privilege;\n\nb)  conducting an analysis of the most common programming errors and\n    documenting that these have been mitigated.\n\n[Review and maintenance]\n\nAfter code has been made operational:\n\na)  updates should be securely packaged and deployed;\n\nb)  reported information security vulnerabilities should be handled (see\n    [[8.8]](#management-of-technical-vulnerabilities));\n\nc)  errors and suspected attacks should be logged and logs regularly\n    reviewed to make adjustments to the code as necessary;\n\nd)  source code should be protected against unauthorized access and\n    tampering (e.g. by using configuration management tools, which\n    typically provide features such as access control and version\n    control).\n\nIf using external tools and libraries, the organization should\nconsider:\n\na)  ensuring that external libraries are managed (e.g. by maintaining an\n    inventory of libraries used and their versions) and regularly\n    updated with release cycles;\n\nb)  selection, authorization and reuse of well-vetted components,\n    > particularly authentication and cryptographic components;\n\nc)  the licence, security and history of external components;\n\nd)  ensuring that software is maintainable, tracked and originates from\n    > proven, reputable sources;\n\ne)  sufficiently long-term availability of development resources and\n    > artefacts.\n\nWhere a software package needs to be modified the following points\nshould be considered:\n\na)  the risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being\n    compromised;\n\nb)  whether to obtain the consent of the vendor;\n\nc)  the possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as\n    standard program updates;\n\nd)  the impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future\n    maintenance of the software as a result of changes;\n\ne)  compatibility with other software in use.",
    "otherInformation": "A guiding principle is to ensure security-relevant code is invoked\nwhen necessary and is tamper- resistant. Programs installed from\ncompiled binary code also have these properties but only for data held\nwithin the application. For interpreted languages, the concept only\nworks when the code is executed on a server that is otherwise\ninaccessible by the users and processes that use it, and that its data\nis held in a similarly protected database. For example, the\ninterpreted code can be run on a cloud service where access to the\ncode itself requires administrator privileges. Such administrator\naccess should be protected by security mechanisms such as just-in-time\nadministration principles and strong authentication. If the\napplication owner can access scripts by direct remote access to the\nserver, so in principle can an attacker. Webservers should be\nconfigured to prevent directory browsing in such cases.\n\nApplication code is best designed on the assumption that it is always\nsubject to attack, through error or malicious action. In addition,\ncritical applications can be designed to be tolerant of internal\nfaults. For example, the output from a complex algorithm can be\nchecked to ensure that it lies within safe bounds before the data is\nused in an application such as a safety or financial critical\napplication. The code that performs the boundary checks is simple and\ntherefore much easier to prove correctness.\n\nSome web applications are susceptible to a variety of vulnerabilities\nthat are introduced by poor design and coding, such as database\ninjection and cross-site scripting attacks. In these attacks, requests\ncan be manipulated to abuse the webserver functionality.\n\nMore information on ICT security evaluation can be found in the\nISO/IEC 15408 series.",

The five examples of attributes\nare (see [[4.2]](#themes-and-attributes)):\n\na)  Control types (\\#Preventive, \\#Detective, \\#Corrective)\n\nb)  Information security properties (\\#Confidentiality, \\#Integrity,\n    \\#Availability)\n\nc)  Cybersecurity concepts (\\#Identify, \\#Protect, \\#Detect, \\#Respond,\n    \\#Recover)\n\nd)  Operational capabilities (\\#Governance, \\#Asset\\_management,\n    \\#Information\\_protection, \\#Human\\_ resource\\_security,\n    \\#Physical\\_security, \\#System\\_and\\_network\\_security,\n    \\#Application\\_security, \\#Secure\\_configuration,\n    \\#Identity\\_and\\_access\\_management, \\#Threat\\_and\\_vulnerability\\_\n    management, \\#Continuity, \\#Supplier\\_relationships\\_security,\n    \\#Legal\\_and\\_compliance,\n    \\#Information\\_security\\_event\\_management,\n    \\#Information\\_security\\_assurance)\n\ne)  Security domains (\\#Governance\\_and\\_Ecosystem, \\#Protection,\n    > \\#Defence, \\#Resilience) [[Table\n    > A.1]](#table-a.1-matrix-of-controls-and-attribute-values)\n    > contains a matrix of all controls in this document with their\n    > given attribute values.\n\nThe filtering or sorting of the matrix can be achieved by using a tool\nsuch as a simple spreadsheet or a database, which can include more\ninformation like control text, guidance, organization-specific\nguidance or attributes (see\n[[A.2]](#organizational-views)).\n\n##### Table A.1 --- Matrix of controls and attribute values\n\n**Table A.1** *(continued)*\n\n**Table A.1** *(continued)*\n\n**Table A.1** *(continued)*\n\n**Table A.1** *(continued)*\n\n**Table A.1** *(continued)*\n\n**Table A.1** *(continued)*\n\n**Table A.1** *(continued)*\n\n**Table A.1** *(continued)*\n\n[[Table A.2]](#table-a.2-view-of-corrective-controls)\nshows an example of how to create a view by filtering by a particular\nattribute value, in this case \\#Corrective.\n\n##### Table A.2 --- View of \\#Corrective controls\n\n**Table A.2** *(continued)*\n\nOrganizational views\n--------------------\n\nSince attributes are used to create different views of controls,\norganizations can discard the examples of attributes proposed in this\ndocument and create their own attributes with different values to\naddress specific needs in the organization. In addition, the values\nassigned to each attribute can differ between organizations since\norganizations can have different views on the use or applicability of\nthe control or of the values associated to the attribute (when the\nvalues are specific to the context of the\n\norganization). The first step is to understand why an\norganizational-specific attribute is desirable. For example, if an\norganization has constructed its risk treatment plans \\[see ISO/IEC\n27001:2013, 6.1.3 e)\\] based on events, it can wish to associate a\nrisk scenario attribute to each control in this document.\n\nThe benefit of such an attribute is to speed up the process of\nfulfilment of ISO/IEC 27001 requirement related to risk treatment,\nwhich is to compare the controls determined through the process of\nrisk treatment (referred to as \"necessary\" controls), with those in\nISO/IEC 27001:2013, Annex A (which are issued from in this document)\nto ensure that no necessary control has been overlooked.\n\nOnce the purpose and benefits are known, the next step is to determine\nthe attribute values. For example, the organization might identify 9\nevents:\n\n1)  loss or theft of mobile device;\n\n2)  loss or theft from organization's premises;\n\n3)  force majeure, vandalism and terrorism;\n\n4)  failure of software, hardware, power, internet and communications;\n\n5)  fraud;\n\n6)  hacking;\n\n7)  disclosure;\n\n8)  breach of the law;\n\n9)  social engineering.\n\nThe second step can therefore be accomplished by assigning identifiers\nto each event (e.g. E1, E2, \\..., E9).\n\nThe third step is to copy the control identifiers and control names\nfrom this document into a spreadsheet or database and associate the\nattribute values with each control, remembering that each control can\nhave more than one attribute value.\n\nThe final step is to sort the spreadsheet or query the database to\nextract the required information. Other examples of organizational\nattributes (and possible values) include:\n\na.  maturity (values from the ISO/IEC 33000 series or other maturity\n    > models);\n\nb.  implementation state (to do, in progress, partially implemented,\n    > fully implemented);\n\nc.  priority (1, 2, 3, etc.);\n\nd.  organizational areas involved (security, ICT, human resources, top\n    > management, etc.);\n\ne.  events;\n\nf.  assets involved;\n\ne\\) build and run, to differentiate controls used in the different\nsteps of the service life cycle;\n\ng.  other frameworks the organization works with or can be transitioning\n    > from.\n\nAnnex B\n=======\n\n(informative)\n\nCorrespondence of ISO/IEC 27002:2022 (this document) with ISO/IEC 27002:2013\n============================================================================\n\nThe purpose of this annex is to provide backwards compatibility with\nISO/IEC 27002:2013 for organizations that are currently using that\nstandard and now wish to transition to this edition.\n\n[[Table\nB.1]](#table-b.1-correspondence-between-controls-in-this-document-and-controls-in-isoiec-270022013)\nprovides the correspondence of the controls specified in [[Clauses\n5]](#organizational-controls) to\n[[8]](#technological-controls) with those in\n\nISO/IEC 27002:2013.\n\n##### Table B.1 --- Correspondence between controls in this document and controls in ISO/IEC 27002:2013\n\n**Table B.1** *(continued)*\n\n**Table B.1** *(continued)*\n\n[[Table\nB.2]](#table-b.2-correspondence-between-controls-in-isoiec-270022013-and-controls-in-this-document)\nprovides the correspondence of controls specified in ISO/IEC\n27002:2013 with those in this\n\ndocument.\n\n##### Table B.2 --- Correspondence between controls in ISO/IEC 27002:2013 and controls in this document\n\n**Table B.2** *(continued)*\n\n**Table B.2** *(continued)*\n\n**Table B.2** *(continued)*\n\n**Table B.2** *(continued)*\n\nBibliography\n============\n\n1.

Where strong\nauthentication and identity verification is required, authentication\nmethods\n\nalternative to passwords, such as digital certificates, smart cards,\ntokens or biometric means, should be\n\nused.\n\nAuthentication information should be accompanied by additional\nauthentication factors for accessing critical information systems\n(also known as multi-factor authentication). Using a combination of\nmultiple authentication factors, such as what you know, what you have\nand what you are, reduces the possibilities for unauthorized accesses.\nMulti-factor authentication can be combined with other techniques to\nrequire additional factors under specific circumstances, based on\npredefined rules and patterns, such as access from an unusual\nlocation, from an unusual device or at an unusual time.\n\nBiometric authentication information should be invalidated if it is\never compromised. Biometric authentication can be unavailable\ndepending on the conditions of use (e.g. moisture or aging). To\nprepare for these issues, biometric authentication should be\naccompanied with at least one alternative authentication technique.\n\nThe procedure for logging into a system or application should be\ndesigned to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. Log-on\nprocedures and technologies should be implemented considering the\nfollowing:\n\na)  not displaying sensitive system or application information until the\n    log-on process has been successfully completed in order to avoid\n    providing an unauthorized user with any unnecessary assistance;\n\nb)  displaying a general notice warning that the system or the\n    application or the service should only be accessed by authorized\n    users;\n\nc)  not providing help messages during the log-on procedure that would\n    aid an unauthorized user (e.g. if an error condition arises, the\n    system should not indicate which part of the data is correct or\n    incorrect);\n\nd)  validating the log-on information only on completion of all input\n    > data;\n\ne)  protecting against brute force log-on attempts on usernames and\n    passwords \\[e.g. using completely automated public Turing test to\n    tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA), requiring password reset\n    after a predefined number of failed attempts or blocking the user\n    after a maximum number of errors\\];\n\nf)  logging unsuccessful and successful attempts;\n\ng)  raising a security event if a potential attempted or successful\n    breach of log-on controls is detected (e.g. sending an alert to the\n    user and the organization's system administrators when a certain\n    number of wrong password attempts has been reached);\n\nh)  displaying or sending the following information on a separate\n    channel on completion of a successful\n\nlog-on:\n\n1.  date and time of the previous successful log-on;\n\n2.  details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last\n    successful log-on;\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\ni)  not displaying a password in clear text when it is being entered; in\n    some cases, it can be required to de-activate this functionality in\n    order to facilitate user log-on (e.g. for accessibility reasons or\n    to avoid blocking users because of repeated errors);\n\nj)  not transmitting passwords in clear text over a network to avoid\n    being captured by a network \\\"sniffer\" program;\n\nk)  terminating inactive sessions after a defined period of inactivity,\n    especially in high risk locations such as public or external areas\n    outside the organization's security management or on user endpoint\n    devices;\n\nl)  restricting connection duration times to provide additional security\n    > for high-risk applications and reduce the window of opportunity\n    > for unauthorized access.",

    "guidance": "[Identifying technical vulnerabilities]\n\nThe organization should have an accurate inventory of assets (see\n[[5.9]](#inventory-of-information-and-other-associated-assets)\nto [[5.14]](#information-transfer)) as a prerequisite for\neffective technical vulnerability management; the inventory should\ninclude the software vendor, software name, version numbers, current\nstate of deployment (e.g. what software is installed on what systems)\nand the person(s) within the organization responsible for the\nsoftware.\n\nTo identify technical vulnerabilities, the organization should\nconsider:\n\na)  defining and establishing the roles and responsibilities associated\n    with technical vulnerability management, including vulnerability\n    monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment, updating, asset tracking\n    and any coordination responsibilities required;\n\nb)  for software and other technologies (based on the asset inventory\n    list, see\n    [[5.9]](#inventory-of-information-and-other-associated-assets)),\n    identifying information resources that will be used for identifying\n    relevant technical vulnerabilities and maintaining awareness about\n    them. Updating the list of information resources based on changes in\n    the inventory or when other new or useful resources are found;\n\nc)  requiring suppliers of information system (including their\n    components) to ensure vulnerability reporting, handling and\n    disclosure, including the requirements in applicable contracts (see\n    [[5.20]](#addressing-information-security-within-supplier-agreements));\n\nd)  using vulnerability scanning tools suitable for the technologies in\n    use to identify vulnerabilities and to verify whether the patching\n    of vulnerabilities was successful;\n\ne)  conducting planned, documented and repeatable penetration tests or\n    vulnerability assessments by competent and authorized persons to\n    support the identification of vulnerabilities. Exercising caution as\n    such activities can lead to a compromise of the security of the\n    system;\n\nf)  tracking the usage of third-party libraries and source code for\n    vulnerabilities. This should be\n\nincluded in secure coding (see [[8.28]](#secure-coding)).\n\nThe organization should develop procedures and capabilities to:\n\na)  detect the existence of vulnerabilities in its products and services\n    including any external component used in these;\n\nb)  receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources.\n\nThe organization should provide a public point of contact as part of a\ntopic-specific policy on vulnerability disclosure so that researchers\nand others are able to report issues. The organization should\nestablish vulnerability reporting procedures, online reporting forms\nand making use of appropriate threat intelligence or information\nsharing forums. The organization should also consider bug bounty\nprograms\n\nwhere rewards are offered as an incentive to assist organizations in\nidentifying vulnerabilities in order to appropriately remediate them.\nThe organization should also share information with competent industry\nbodies or other interested parties.\n\n[Evaluating technical vulnerabilities]\n\nTo evaluate identified technical vulnerabilities, the following\nguidance should be considered:\n\na.  analyse and verify reports to determine what response and\n    remediation activity is needed;\n\nb.  once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified,\n    identifying the associated risks and the actions to be taken. Such\n    actions can involve updating vulnerable systems or applying other\n    controls.\n\n[Taking appropriate measures to address technical\nvulnerabilities]\n\nA software update management process should be implemented to ensure\nthe most up-to-date approved patches and application updates are\ninstalled for all authorized software. If changes are necessary, the\noriginal software should be retained and the changes applied to a\ndesignated copy. All changes should be fully tested and documented, so\nthat they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades.\nIf required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an\nindependent evaluation body.\n\nThe following guidance should be considered to address technical\nvulnerabilities:\n\na)  taking appropriate and timely action in response to the\n    identification of potential technical vulnerabilities; defining a\n    timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical\n    vulnerabilities;\n\nb)  depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be\n    addressed, carrying out the action according to the controls related\n    to change management (see [[8.32]](#change-management))\n    or by following information security incident response procedures\n    (see\n    [[5.26]](#response-to-information-security-incidents));\n\nc)  only using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or\n    external to the organization);\n\nd)  testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure\n    they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be\n    tolerated \\[i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks\n    associated with installing the update (the risks posed by the\n    vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the\n    update)\\];\n\ne)  addressing systems at high risk first;\n\nf)  develop remediation (typically software updates or patches);\n\ng)  test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective;\n\nh)  provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation;\n\ni)  if no update is available or the update cannot be installed,\n    considering other controls, such as:\n\n    1.  applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or\n        other relevant sources;\n\n    2.  turning off services or capabilities related to the\n        vulnerability;\n\n    3.  adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network\n        borders (see [[8.20]](#networks-security) to\n        [[8.22]](#segregation-of-networks));\n\n    4.  shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from\n        attack through deployment of suitable traffic filters (sometimes\n        called virtual patching);\n\n    5.  increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks;\n\n    6.  raising awareness of the vulnerability.\n\nFor acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information\nabout security updates for their software and provide a facility to\ninstall such updates automatically, the organization should decide\nwhether to use the automatic update or not.\n\n[Other considerations]\n\nAn audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical\nvulnerability management.\n\nThe technical vulnerability management process should be regularly\nmonitored and evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and\nefficiency.\n\nAn effective technical vulnerability management process should be\naligned with incident management activities, to communicate data on\nvulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide\ntechnical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs.\n\nWhere the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party\ncloud service provider, technical vulnerability management of cloud\nservice provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service\nprovider. The cloud service provider's responsibilities for technical\nvulnerability management should be part of the cloud service agreement\nand this should include processes for reporting the cloud service\nprovider\\'s actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see\n[[5.23]](#information-security-for-use-of-cloud-services)).\nFor some cloud services, there are respective responsibilities for the\ncloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example,\nthe cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management\nof its own assets used for the cloud services.",
    "otherInformation": "Technical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of\nchange management and as such can take advantage of the change\nmanagement processes and procedures (see\n[[8.32]](#change-management)).\n\nThere is a possibility that an update does not address the problem\nadequately and has negative side effects. Also, in some cases,\nuninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has\nbeen applied.\n\nIf adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of\ncosts or lack of resources) a delay in updating can be considered to\nevaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by\nother users. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial.\n\nWhere software patches or updates are produced, the organization can\nconsider providing an automated update process where these updates are\ninstalled on affected systems or products without the need for\nintervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update\nprocess is offered, it can allow the customer or user to choose an\noption to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of the\ninstallation of the update.\n\nWhere the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates\ncan be installed on affected systems or products without the need for\nintervention, the organization determines if it applies the automated\nprocess or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to\nretain control over when the update is performed. For example, a\nsoftware used for a business operation cannot be updated until the\noperation has completed.\n\nA weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does\nnot fully account for defence in depth: two countermeasures that are\nalways invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked by\nstrengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not\nvulnerable, whereas a vulnerability scanner can report that both\ncomponents are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care\nin reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports.\n\nMany organizations supply software, systems, products and services not\nonly within the organization but also to interested parties such as\ncustomers, partners or other users. These software, systems, products\nand services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect\nthe security of users.\n\nOrganizations can release remediation and disclose information about\nvulnerabilities to users (typically through a public advisory) and\nprovide appropriate information for software vulnerability database\nservices.\n\nFor more information relating to the management of technical\nvulnerabilities when using cloud computing, see the ISO/IEC 19086\nseries and ISO/IEC 27017.\n\nISO/IEC 29147 provides detailed information on receiving vulnerability\nreports and publishing vulnerability advisories.
