Introduction
============

##### Background and context

> This document is designed for organizations of all types and sizes. It
> is to be used as a reference for determining and implementing controls
> for information security risk treatment in an information security
> management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001. It can also be used
> as a guidance document for organizations determining and implementing
> commonly accepted information security controls. Furthermore, this
> document is intended for use in developing industry and organization-
> specific information security management guidelines, taking into
> consideration their specific information security risk environment(s).
> Organizational or environment-specific controls other than those
> included in this document can be determined through risk assessment as
> necessary.
>
> Organizations of all types and sizes (including public and private
> sector, commercial and non-profit) create, collect, process, store,
> transmit and dispose of information in many forms, including
> electronic, physical and verbal (e.g. conversations and
> presentations).
>
> The value of information goes beyond written words, numbers and
> images: knowledge, concepts, ideas and brands are examples of
> intangible forms of information. In an interconnected world,
> information and other associated assets deserve or require protection
> against various risk sources, whether natural, accidental or
> deliberate.
>
> Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of
> controls, including policies, rules, processes, procedures,
> organizational structures and software and hardware functions. To meet
> its specific security and business objectives, the organization should
> define, implement, monitor, review and improve these controls where
> necessary. An ISMS such as that specified in ISO/IEC 27001 takes a
> holistic, coordinated view of the organization's information security
> risks in order to determine and implement a comprehensive suite of
> information security controls within the overall framework of a
> coherent management system.
>
> Many information systems, including their management and operations,
> have not been designed to be secure in terms of an ISMS as specified
> in ISO/IEC 27001 and this document. The level of security that can be
> achieved only through technological measures is limited and should be
> supported by appropriate management activities and organizational
> processes. Identifying which controls should be in place requires
> careful planning and attention to detail while carrying out risk
> treatment.
>
> A successful ISMS requires support from all personnel in the
> organization. It can also require participation from other interested
> parties, such as shareholders or suppliers. Advice from subject matter
> experts can also be needed.
>
> A suitable, adequate and effective information security management
> system provides assurance to the organization's management and other
> interested parties that their information and other associated assets
> are kept reasonably secure and protected against threats and harm,
> thereby enabling the organization to achieve the stated business
> objectives.

##### Information security requirements

> It is essential that an organization determines its information
> security requirements. There are three main sources of information
> security requirements:

a)  the assessment of risks to the organization, taking into account the
    organization's overall business strategy and objectives. This can be
    facilitated or supported through an information security- specific
    risk assessment. This should result in the determination of the
    controls necessary to ensure that the residual risk to the
    organization meets its risk acceptance criteria;

b)  the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements that
    an organization and its interested parties (trading partners,
    service providers, etc.) have to comply with and their socio-
    cultural environment;

c)  the set of principles, objectives and business requirements for all
    > the steps of the life cycle of information that an organization
    > has developed to support its operations.

    1.  ##### Controls

> A control is defined as a measure that modifies or maintains risk.
> Some of the controls in this document are controls that modify risk,
> while others maintain risk. An information security policy, for
> example, can only maintain risk, whereas compliance with the
> information security policy can modify risk. Moreover, some controls
> describe the same generic measure in different risk contexts. This
> document provides a generic mixture of organizational, people,
> physical and technological information security controls derived from
> internationally recognized best practices.

##### Determining controls

> Determining controls is dependent on the organization's decisions
> following a risk assessment, with a clearly defined scope. Decisions
> related to identified risks should be based on the criteria for risk
> acceptance, risk treatment options and the risk management approach
> applied by the organization. The determination of controls should also
> take into consideration all relevant national and international
> legislation and regulations. Control determination also depends on the
> manner in which controls interact with one another to provide defence
> in depth.
>
> The organization can design controls as required or identify them from
> any source. In specifying such controls, the organization should
> consider the resources and investment needed to implement and operate
> a control against the business value realized. See ISO/IEC TR 27016
> for guidance on decisions regarding the investment in an ISMS and the
> economic consequences of these decisions in the context of competing
> requirements for resources.
>
> There should be a balance between the resources deployed for
> implementing controls and the potential resulting business impact from
> security incidents in the absence of those controls. The results of a
> risk assessment should help guide and determine the appropriate
> management action, priorities for managing information security risks
> and for implementing controls determined necessary to protect against
> these risks.
>
> Some of the controls in this document can be considered as guiding
> principles for information security management and as being applicable
> for most organizations. More information about determining controls
> and other risk treatment options can be found in ISO/IEC 27005.

##### Developing organization-specific guidelines

> This document can be regarded as a starting point for developing
> organization-specific guidelines. Not all of the controls and guidance
> in this document can be applicable to all organizations. Additional
> controls and guidelines not included in this document can also be
> required to address the specific needs of the organization and the
> risks that have been identified. When documents are developed
> containing additional guidelines or controls, it can be useful to
> include cross-references to clauses in this document for future
> reference.

##### Life cycle considerations

> Information has a life cycle, from creation to disposal. The value of,
> and risks to, information can vary throughout this life cycle (e.g.
> unauthorized disclosure or theft of a company's financial accounts is
> not significant after they have been published, but integrity remains
> critical) therefore, information security remains important to some
> extent at all stages.
>
> Information systems and other assets relevant to information security
> have life cycles within which they are conceived, specified, designed,
> developed, tested, implemented, used, maintained and eventually
> retired from service and disposed of. Information security should be
> considered at every stage. New system development projects and changes
> to existing systems provide opportunities to improve security controls
> while taking into account the organization's risks and lessons learned
> from incidents.

##### Related International Standards

> While this document offers guidance on a broad range of information
> security controls that are commonly applied in many different
> organizations, other documents in the ISO/IEC 27000 family provide
> complementary advice or requirements on other aspects of the overall
> process of managing information security.
>
> Refer to ISO/IEC 27000 for a general introduction to both ISMS and the
> family of documents. ISO/IEC 27000 provides a glossary, defining most
> of the terms used throughout the ISO/IEC 27000 family of documents,
> and describes the scope and objectives for each member of the family.
>
> There are sector-specific standards that have additional controls
> which aim at addressing specific areas (e.g. ISO/IEC 27017 for cloud
> services, ISO/IEC 27701 for privacy, ISO/IEC 27019 for energy, ISO/IEC
> 27011 for telecommunications organizations and ISO 27799 for health).
> Such standards are included in the Bibliography and some of them are

4.  Structure of this document
    --------------------------

    1.  #### Clauses

> This document is structured as follows:

a)  Organizational controls ([[Clause
    5]{.underline}](#organizational-controls))

b)  People controls ([[Clause 6]{.underline}](#people-controls))

c)  Physical controls ([[Clause 7]{.underline}](#physical-controls))

d)  Technological controls ([[Clause
    > 8]{.underline}](#technological-controls)) There are 2 informative
    > annexes:

> --- [[Annex A]{.underline}](#Annex_A_(informative)_Using_attributes_)
> --- Using attributes
>
> --- [[Annex
> B]{.underline}](#correspondence-of-isoiec-270022022-this-document-with-isoiec-270022013)
> --- Correspondence with ISO/IEC 27002:2013
>
> [[Annex A]{.underline}](#Annex_A_(informative)_Using_attributes_)
> explains how an organization can use attributes (see
> [[4.2]{.underline}](#themes-and-attributes)) to create its own views
> based on the control attributes defined in this document or of its own
> creation.
>
> [[Annex
> B]{.underline}](#correspondence-of-isoiec-270022022-this-document-with-isoiec-270022013)
> shows the correspondence between the controls in this edition of
> ISO/IEC 27002 and the previous 2013 edition.

#### Themes and attributes

> The categorization of controls given in [[Clauses
> 5]{.underline}](#organizational-controls) to
> [[8]{.underline}](#technological-controls) are referred to as themes.
> Controls are categorized as:

a)  people, if they concern individual people;

b)  physical, if they concern physical objects;

c)  technological, if they concern technology;

d)  otherwise they are categorized as organizational.

> The organization can use attributes to create different views which
> are different categorizations of controls as seen from a different
> perspective to the themes. Attributes can be used to filter, sort or
> present controls in different views for different audiences. [[Annex
> A]{.underline}](#Annex_A_(informative)_Using_attributes_) explains how
> this can be achieved and provides an example of a view.
>
> By way of example, each control in this document has been associated
> with five attributes with corresponding attribute values (preceded by
> \"\#\" to make them searchable), as follows:

a)  Control type

> Control type is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of
> when and how the control modifies the risk with regard to the
> occurrence of an information security incident. Attribute values
> consist of Preventive (the control that is intended to prevent the
> occurrence of an information security incident), Detective (the
> control acts when an information security incident occurs) and
> Corrective (the control acts after an information security incident
> occurs).

b)  Information security properties

> Information security properties is an attribute to view controls from
> the perspective of which characteristic of information the control
> will contribute to preserving. Attribute values consist of
> Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

c)  Cybersecurity concepts

> Cybersecurity concepts is an attribute to view controls from the
> perspective of the association of controls to cybersecurity concepts
> defined in the cybersecurity framework described in ISO/IEC TS 27110.
> Attribute values consist of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and
> Recover.

d)  Operational capabilities

> Operational capabilities is an attribute to view controls from the
> practitioner's perspective of information security capabilities.
> Attribute values consist of Governance, Asset\_management,
> Information\_protection, Human\_resource\_security,
> Physical\_security, System\_and\_network\_ security,
> Application\_security, Secure\_configuration,
> Identity\_and\_access\_management,
> Threat\_and\_vulnerability\_management, Continuity,
> Supplier\_relationships\_security, Legal\_and\_ compliance,
> Information\_security\_event\_management and
> Information\_security\_assurance.

e)  Security domains

> Security domains is an attribute to view controls from the perspective
> of four information security domains: "Governance and Ecosystem"
> includes "Information System Security Governance & Risk Management"
> and "Ecosystem cybersecurity management" (including internal and
> external stakeholders); "Protection" includes "IT Security
> Architecture", "IT Security Administration", "Identity and access
> management", "IT Security Maintenance" and "Physical and environmental
> security"; "Defence" includes "Detection" and "Computer Security
> Incident Management"; "Resilience" includes "Continuity of operations"
> and "Crisis management". Attribute values consist of
> Governance\_and\_Ecosystem, Protection, Defence and Resilience.
>
> The attributes given in this document are selected because they are
> considered generic enough to be used by different types of
> organizations. Organizations can choose to disregard one or more of
> the attributes given in this document. They can also create attributes
> of their own (with the corresponding attribute values) to create their
> own organizational views. [[Clause
> A.2]{.underline}](#organizational-views) includes examples of such
> attributes.

#### Control layout

> The layout for each control contains the following:

-   **Control title:** Short name of the control;

-   **Attribute table**: A table shows the value(s) of each attribute
    > for the given control;

-   **Control:** What the control is;

-   **Purpose**: Why the control should be implemented;

-   **Guidance:** How the control should be implemented;

-   **Other information:** Explanatory text or references to other
    > related documents.

> Subheadings are used in the guidance text for some controls to aid
> readability where guidance is lengthy and addresses multiple topics.
> Such headings are not necessarily used in all guidance text.
> Subheadings are [underlined]{.underline}.

##### Control

> Information security policy and topic-specific policies should be
> defined, approved by management, published, communicated to and
> acknowledged by relevant personnel and relevant interested parties,
> and reviewed at planned intervals and if significant changes occur.

##### Purpose

> To ensure continuing suitability, adequacy, effectiveness of
> management direction and support for information security in
> accordance with business, legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual
> requirements.

##### Guidance

> At the highest level, the organization should define an "information
> security policy" which is approved by top management and which sets
> out the organization's approach to managing its information security.
>
> The information security policy should take into consideration
> requirements derived from:

a)  business strategy and requirements;

b)  regulations, legislation and contracts;

c)  the current and projected information security risks and threats.
    > The information security policy should contain statements
    > concerning:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a)  definition of information security;

b)  information security objectives or the framework for setting
    information security objectives;

c)  principles to guide all activities relating to information security;

d)  commitment to satisfy applicable requirements related to information
    > security;

e)  commitment to continual improvement of the information security
    management system;

f)  assignment of responsibilities for information security management
    to defined roles;

g)  procedures for handling exemptions and exceptions.

> Top management should approve any changes to the information security
> policy.
>
> At a lower level, the information security policy should be supported
> by topic-specific policies as needed, to further mandate the
> implementation of information security controls. Topic-specific
> policies are typically structured to address the needs of certain

> Examples of such topics include:

a)  access control;

b)  physical and environmental security;

c)  asset management;

d)  information transfer;

e)  secure configuration and handling of user endpoint devices;

f)  networking security;

i)  cryptography and key management;

j)  information classification and handling;

k)  management of technical vulnerabilities;

l)  secure development.

> The responsibility for the development, review and approval of the
> topic-specific policies should be allocated to relevant personnel
> based on their appropriate level of authority and technical
> competency. The review should include assessing opportunities for
> improvement of the organization's information security policy and
> topic-specific policies and managing information security in response
> to changes to:

a.  the organization's business strategy;

b.  the organization's technical environment;

c.  regulations, statutes, legislation and contracts;

d.  information security risks;

e.  the current and projected information security threat environment;

f.  lessons learned from information security events and incidents.

> The review of information security policy and topic-specific policies

> these policy documents that meet the organization's needs. In some
> organizations, the information security policy and topic-specific
> policies can be in a single document. The organization can name these

##### Control

> Information security roles and responsibilities should be defined and
> allocated according to the organization needs.

##### Purpose

> To establish a defined, approved and understood structure for the
> implementation, operation and management of information security
> within the organization.

##### Guidance

> Allocation of information security roles and responsibilities should
> be done in accordance with the information security policy and
> topic-specific policies (see
> [[5.1]{.underline}](#policies-for-information-security)). The
> organization should define and manage responsibilities for:

a)  protection of information and other associated assets;

b)  carrying out specific information security processes;

c)  information security risk management activities and in particular
    acceptance of residual risks (e.g. to risk owners);

d)  all personnel using an organization's information and other
    > associated assets.

> These responsibilities should be supplemented, where necessary, with
> more detailed guidance for specific sites and information processing
> facilities. Individuals with allocated information security
> responsibilities can assign security tasks to others. However, they
> remain accountable and should determine that any delegated tasks have
> been correctly performed.
>
> Each security area for which individuals are responsible should be
> defined, documented and communicated. Authorization levels should be
> defined and documented. Individuals who take on a specific information
> security role should be competent in the knowledge and skills required
> by the role and should be supported to keep up to date with
> developments related to the role and required in order to fulfil the
> responsibilities of the role.

##### Other information

> Many organizations appoint an information security manager to take
> overall responsibility for the development and implementation of
> information security and to support the identification of risks and
> mitigating controls.
>
> However, responsibility for resourcing and implementing the controls
> often remains with individual managers. One common practice is to
> appoint an owner for each asset who then becomes responsible for its
> day-to-day protection.
>
> Depending on the size and resourcing of an organization, information
> security can be covered by dedicated roles or duties carried out in
> addition to existing roles.

##### Control

> Conflicting duties and conflicting areas of responsibility should be
> segregated.

##### Purpose

> To reduce the risk of fraud, error and bypassing of information
> security controls.

##### Guidance

> Segregation of duties and areas of responsibility aims to separate
> conflicting duties between different individuals in order to prevent
> one individual from executing potential conflicting duties on their
> own.
>
> The organization should determine which duties and areas of
> responsibility need to be segregated. The following are examples of
> activities that can require segregation:

a)  initiating, approving and executing a change;

b)  requesting, approving and implementing access rights;

c)  designing, implementing and reviewing code;

d)  developing software and administering production systems;

e)  using and administering applications;

f)  using applications and administering databases;

g)  designing, auditing and assuring information security controls.

> The possibility of collusion should be considered in designing the
> segregation controls. Small organizations can find segregation of
> duties difficult to achieve, but the principle should be applied as
> far as is possible and practicable. Whenever it is difficult to
> segregate, other controls should be considered, such as monitoring of
> activities, audit trails and management supervision.
>
> Care should be taken when using role-based access control systems to
> ensure that persons are not granted conflicting roles. When there is a
> large number of roles, the organization should consider using
> automated tools to identify conflicts and facilitate their removal.
> Roles should be carefully defined and provisioned to minimize access
> problems if a role is removed or reassigned.

##### Purpose

> To provide awareness of the organization's threat environment so that
> the appropriate mitigation actions can be taken.

##### Guidance

> Information about existing or emerging threats is collected and
> analysed in order to:

a)  facilitate informed actions to prevent the threats from causing harm
    to the organization;

b)  reduce the impact of such threats.

> Threat intelligence can be divided into three layers, which should all
> be considered:

a)  strategic threat intelligence: exchange of high-level information
    about the changing threat landscape (e.g. types of attackers or
    types of attacks);

b)  tactical threat intelligence: information about attacker
    methodologies, tools and technologies involved;

c)  operational threat intelligence: details about specific attacks,
    > including technical indicators. Threat intelligence should be:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a)  relevant (i.e. related to the protection of the organization);

b)  insightful (i.e. providing the organization with an accurate and
    detailed understanding of the threat landscape);

c)  contextual, to provide situational awareness (i.e. adding context to
    the information based on the time of events, where they occur,
    previous experiences and prevalence in similar organizations);

d)  actionable (i.e. the organization can act on information quickly and
    > effectively). Threat intelligence activities should include:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a)  establishing objectives for threat intelligence production;

b)  identifying, vetting and selecting internal and external information
    sources that are necessary and appropriate to provide information
    required for the production of threat intelligence;

c)  collecting information from selected sources, which can be internal
    and external;

d)  processing information collected to prepare it for analysis (e.g. by
    translating, formatting or corroborating information);

e)  analysing information to understand how it relates and is meaningful
    to the organization;

f)  communicating and sharing it to relevant individuals in a format
    > that can be understood. Threat intelligence should be analysed and
    > later used:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a)  by implementing processes to include information gathered from
    threat intelligence sources into the organization's information
    security risk management processes;

b)  as additional input to technical preventive and detective controls
    like firewalls, intrusion detection system, or anti malware
    solutions;

c)  as input to the information security test processes and techniques.

> The organization should share threat intelligence with other
> organizations on a mutual basis in order to improve overall threat

##### Other information

> Organizations can use threat intelligence to prevent, detect, or
> respond to threats. Organizations can produce threat intelligence, but

>
> The project management in use should require that:

a)  information security risks are assessed and treated at an early
    stage and periodically as part of project risks throughout the
    project life cycle;

b)  information security requirements \[e.g. application security
    > requirements
    > ([[8.26]{.underline}](#application-security-requirements)),
    > requirements for complying with intellectual property rights
    > ([[5.32]{.underline}](#intellectual-property-rights)), etc.\] are
    > addressed in the early stages of projects;

c)  information security risks associated with the execution of
    > projects, such as security of internal and external communication
    > aspects are considered and treated throughout the project life
    > cycle;

d)  progress on information security risk treatment is reviewed and
    > effectiveness of the treatment is evaluated and tested.

> The appropriateness of the information security considerations and
> activities should be followed up at predefined stages by suitable
> persons or governance bodies, such as the project steering committee.
>
> Responsibilities and authorities for information security relevant to
> the project should be defined and allocated to specified roles.
>
> Information security requirements for products or services to be
> delivered by the project should be determined using various methods,
> including deriving compliance requirements from information security
> policy, topic-specific policies and regulations. Further information
> security requirements can be derived from activities such as threat
> modelling, incident reviews, use of vulnerability thresholds or
> contingency planning, thus ensuring that the architecture and design
> of information systems are protected against known threats based on
> the operational environment.
>
> Information security requirements should be determined for all types
> of projects, not only ICT development projects. The following should
> also be considered when determining these requirements:

a)  what information is involved (information determination), what are
    the corresponding information security needs (classification; see
    [[5.12]{.underline}](#classification-of-information)) and the
    potential negative business impact which can result from lack of
    adequate security;

b)  the required protection needs of information and other associated
    assets involved, particularly in terms of confidentiality, integrity
    and availability;

c)  the level of confidence or assurance required towards the claimed
    identity of entities in order to derive the authentication
    requirements;

d)  access provisioning and authorization processes, for customers and
    other potential business users as well as for privileged or
    technical users such as relevant project members, potential
    operation staff or external suppliers;

e)  informing users of their duties and responsibilities;

f)  requirements derived from business processes, such as transaction
    logging and monitoring, non- repudiation requirements;

g)  requirements mandated by other information security controls (e.g.
    interfaces to logging and monitoring or data leakage detection
    systems);

h)  compliance with the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual
    environment in which the organization operates;

i)  level of confidence or assurance required for third parties to meet
    the organization's information security policy and topic-specific
    policies including relevant security clauses in any agreements or
    contracts.

##### Other information

> The project development approach, such as waterfall life cycle or

##### Control

> An inventory of information and other associated assets, including
> owners, should be developed and maintained.

##### Purpose

> To identify the organization's information and other associated assets
> in order to preserve their information security and assign appropriate
> ownership.

##### Guidance

> [Inventory]{.underline}
>
> The organization should identify its information and other associated
> assets and determine their importance in terms of information
> security. Documentation should be maintained in dedicated or existing
> inventories as appropriate.
>
> The inventory of information and other associated assets should be
> accurate, up to date, consistent and aligned with other inventories.
> Options for ensuring accuracy of an inventory of information and other
> associated assets include:

a)  conducting regular reviews of identified information and other
    associated assets against the asset inventory;

b)  automatically enforcing an inventory update in the process of
    installing, changing or removing an asset.

> The location of an asset should be included in the inventory as
> appropriate.
>
> The inventory does not need to be a single list of information and
> other associated assets. Considering that the inventory should be
> maintained by the relevant functions, it can be seen as a set of
> dynamic inventories, such as inventories for information assets,
> hardware, software, virtual machines (VMs), facilities, personnel,
> competence, capabilities and records.
>
> Each asset should be classified in accordance with the classification
> of the information (see
> [[5.12]{.underline}](#classification-of-information)) associated to
> that asset.
>
> The granularity of the inventory of information and other associated
> assets should be at a level appropriate for the needs of the
> organization. Sometimes specific instances of assets in the
> information life cycle are not feasible to be documented due to the
> nature of the asset. An example of a short-lived asset is a VM
> instance whose life cycle can be of short duration.
>
> [Ownership]{.underline}
>
> For the identified information and other associated assets, ownership
> of the asset should be assigned to an individual or a group and the
> classification should be identified (see
> [[5.12]{.underline}](#classification-of-information),
> [[5.13]{.underline}](#labelling-of-information)). A process to ensure
> timely assignment of asset ownership should be implemented. Ownership
> should be assigned when assets are created or when assets are
> transferred to the organization. Asset ownership should be reassigned
> as necessary when current asset owners leave or change job roles.
>
> [Owner duties]{.underline}
>
> The asset owner should be responsible for the proper management of an
> asset over the whole asset life cycle, ensuring that:

a)  information and other associated assets are inventoried;

b)  information and other associated assets are appropriately classified
    and protected;

c)  the classification is reviewed periodically;

d)  components supporting technology assets are listed and linked, such
    as database, storage, software components and sub-components;

e)  requirements for the acceptable use of information and other
    associated assets (see
    [[5.10]{.underline}](#acceptable-use-of-information-and-other-associated-assets))
    are established;

f)  access restrictions correspond with the classification and that they
    are effective and are reviewed periodically;

g)  information and other associated assets, when deleted or disposed,
    are handled in a secure manner and removed from the inventory;

h)  they are involved in the identification and management of risks
    > associated with their asset(s);

i)  they support personnel who have the roles and responsibilities of
    > managing their information.

##### Other information

> Inventories of information and other associated assets are often
> necessary to ensure the effective protection of information and can be
> required for other purposes, such as health and safety, insurance or
> financial reasons. Inventories of information and other associated
> assets also support risk management, audit activities, vulnerability
> management, incident response and recovery planning.
>
> Tasks and responsibilities can be delegated (e.g. to a custodian
> looking after the assets on a daily basis), but the person or group
> who delegated them remains accountable.
>
> It can be useful to designate groups of information and other
> associated assets which act together to provide a particular service.
> In this case, the owner of this service is accountable for the
> delivery of the service, including the operation of its assets.
>
> See ISO/IEC 19770-1 for additional information on information
> technology (IT) asset management. See ISO 55001 for additional
> information on asset management.

##### Control

> Rules for the acceptable use and procedures for handling information
> and other associated assets should be identified, documented and
> implemented.

##### Purpose

> To ensure information and other associated assets are appropriately
> protected, used and handled.

##### Guidance

> Personnel and external party users using or having access to the
> organization's information and other associated assets should be made
> aware of the information security requirements for protecting and
> handling the organization's information and other associated assets.
> They should be responsible for their use of any information processing
> facilities.
>
> The organization should establish a topic-specific policy on the
> acceptable use of information and other associated assets and
> communicate it to anyone who uses or handles information and other
> associated assets. The topic-specific policy on acceptable use should
> provide clear direction on how individuals are expected to use
> information and other associated assets. The topic-specific policy
> should state:

a)  expected and unacceptable behaviours of individuals from an
    information security perspective;

b)  permitted and prohibited use of information and other associated
    assets;

c)  monitoring activities being performed by the organization.

> Acceptable use procedures should be drawn up for the full information
> life cycle in accordance with its classification (see
> [[5.12]{.underline}](#classification-of-information)) and determined
> risks. The following items should be considered:

a)  access restrictions supporting the protection requirements for each
    level of classification;

b)  maintenance of a record of the authorized users of information and
    other associated assets;

c)  protection of temporary or permanent copies of information to a
    > level consistent with the protection of the original information;

d)  storage of assets associated with information in accordance with
    > manufacturers' specifications

> (see [[7.8]{.underline}](#equipment-siting-and-protection));

e)  clear marking of all copies of storage media (electronic or
    > physical) for the attention of the authorized recipient (see
    > [[7.10]{.underline}](#storage-media));

f)  authorization of disposal of information and other associated assets
    > and supported deletion

> method(s) (see [[8.10]{.underline}](#information-deletion)).

##### Other information

> It can be the case that the assets concerned do not directly belong to
> the organization, such as public cloud services. The use of such
> third-party assets and any assets of the organization associated with
> such external assets (e.g. information, software) should be identified
> as applicable and controlled, for example, through agreements with
> cloud service providers. Care should also be taken when a
> collaborative working environment is used.

> termination of their employment, contract or agreement.

##### Purpose

> To protect the organization's assets as part of the process of
> changing or terminating employment, contract or agreement.

##### Guidance

> The change or termination process should be formalized to include the
> return of all previously issued physical and electronic assets owned
> by or entrusted to the organization.
>
> In cases where personnel and other interested parties purchase the
> organization's equipment or use their own personal equipment,
> procedures should be followed to ensure that all relevant information
> is traced and transferred to the organization and securely deleted
> from the equipment (see
> [[7.14]{.underline}](#secure-disposal-or-re-use-of-equipment)).
>
> In cases where personnel and other interested parties have knowledge
> that is important to ongoing operations, that information should be
> documented and transferred to the organization.
>
> During the notice period and thereafter, the organization should
> prevent unauthorized copying of relevant information (e.g.
> intellectual property) by personnel under notice of termination.
>
> The organization should clearly identify and document all information
> and other associated assets to be returned which can include:

a)  user endpoint devices;

b)  portable storage devices;

c)  specialist equipment;

d)  authentication hardware (e.g. mechanical keys, physical tokens and
    > smartcards) for information systems, sites and physical archives;

e)  physical copies of information.

##### Other information

> It can be difficult to return information held on assets which are not
> owned by the organization. In such cases, it is necessary to restrict
> the use of information using other information security controls such
> as access rights management ([[5.18]{.underline}](#access-rights)) or
> use of cryptography ([[8.24]{.underline}](#use-of-cryptography)).

##### Control

> Information should be classified according to the information security
> needs of the organization based on confidentiality, integrity,
> availability and relevant interested party requirements.

##### Purpose

> To ensure identification and understanding of protection needs of
> information in accordance with its importance to the organization.

##### Guidance

> The organization should establish a topic-specific policy on
> information classification and communicate it to all relevant
> interested parties.
>
> The organization should take into account requirements for
> confidentiality, integrity and availability in the classification
> scheme.
>
> Classifications and associated protective controls for information
> should take account of business needs for sharing or restricting
> information, for protecting integrity of information and for assuring
> availability, as well as legal requirements concerning the
> confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information. Assets
> other than information can also be classified in compliance with
> classification of information, which is stored in, processed by or
> otherwise handled or protected by the asset.
>
> Owners of information should be accountable for their classification.
>
> The classification scheme should include conventions for
> classification and criteria for review of the classification over
> time. Results of classification should be updated in accordance with
> changes of the value, sensitivity and criticality of information
> through their life cycle.
>
> The scheme should be aligned to the topic-specific policy on access
> control (see [[5.1]{.underline}](#policies-for-information-security))
> and should be able to address specific business needs of the
> organization.
>
> The classification can be determined by the level of impact that the
> information\'s compromise would have for the organization. Each level
> defined in the scheme should be given a name that makes sense in the
> context of the classification scheme's application.
>
> The scheme should be consistent across the whole organization and
> included in its procedures so that everyone classifies information and
> applicable other associated assets in the same way. In this manner,
> everyone has a common understanding of protection requirements and
> applies appropriate protection.
>
> The classification scheme used within the organization can be
> different from the schemes used by other organizations, even if the
> names for levels are similar. In addition, information moving between
>
> organizations can vary in classification depending on its context in
> each organization, even if their classification schemes are identical.
> Therefore, agreements with other organizations that include
> information sharing should include procedures to identify the
> classification of that information and to interpret the classification
> levels from other organizations. Correspondence between different
> schemes can be determined by looking for equivalence in the associated
> handling and protection methods.

##### Other information

> Classification provides people who deal with information with a
> concise indication of how to handle and protect it. Creating groups of
> information with similar protection needs and specifying information
> security procedures that apply to all the information in each group
> facilitates this. This approach reduces the need for case-by-case risk
> assessment and custom design of controls.
>
> Information can cease to be sensitive or critical after a certain
> period of time. For example, when the information has been made
> public, it no longer has confidentiality requirements but can still
> require protection for its integrity and availability properties.
> These aspects should be taken into account, as over-classification can
> lead to the implementation of unnecessary controls resulting in
> additional expense or, on the contrary, under-classification can lead
> to insufficient controls to protect the information from compromise.
>
> As an example, an information confidentiality classification scheme
> can be based on four levels as
>
> follows:

a)  disclosure causes no harm;

b)  disclosure causes minor reputational damage or minor operational
    impact;

c)  disclosure has a significant short-term impact on operations or
    business objectives;

d)  disclosure has a serious impact on long term business objectives or
    puts the survival of the organization at risk.

##### Control

> An appropriate set of procedures for information labelling should be
> developed and implemented in accordance with the information
> classification scheme adopted by the organization.

##### Purpose

> To facilitate the communication of classification of information and
> support automation of information processing and management.

##### Guidance

> Procedures for information labelling should cover information and
> other associated assets in all formats. The labelling should reflect
> the classification scheme established in
> [[5.12]{.underline}](#classification-of-information). The labels
> should be easily recognizable. The procedures should give guidance on
> where and how labels are attached in consideration of how the
> information is accessed or the assets are handled depending on the
> types of storage media. The procedures can define:

a)  cases where labelling is omitted (e.g. labelling of non-confidential
    information to reduce workloads);

b)  how to label information sent by or stored on electronic or physical
    means, or any other format;

c)  how to handle cases where labelling is not possible (e.g. due to
    > technical restrictions). Examples of labelling techniques include:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a)  physical labels;

b)  headers and footers;

c)  metadata;

d)  watermarking;

e)  rubber-stamps.

> Digital information should utilize metadata in order to identify,
> manage and control information, especially with regard to
> confidentiality. Metadata should also enable efficient and correct
> searching for information. Metadata should facilitate systems to
> interact and make decisions based on the associated classification
> labels.
>
> The procedures should describe how to attach metadata to information,
> what labels to use and how data should be handled, in line with the
> organization's information model and ICT architecture.
>
> Relevant additional metadata should be added by systems when they
> process information depending on its information security properties.
>
> Personnel and other interested parties should be made aware of
> labelling procedures. All personnel should be provided with the
> necessary training to ensure that information is correctly labelled
> and handled accordingly.
>
> Output from systems containing information that is classified as being
> sensitive or critical should carry an appropriate classification
> label.

##### Other information

> Labelling of classified information is a key requirement for
> information sharing.
>
> Other useful metadata that can be attached to the information is which
> organizational process created the information and at what time.
>
> Labelling of information and other associated assets can sometimes
> have negative effects. Classified assets can be easier to identify by
> malicious actors for potential misuse.
>
> Some systems do not label individual files or database records with
> their classification but protect all information at the highest level
> of classification of any of the information that it contains or is
> permitted to contain. It is usual in such systems to determine and
> then label information when it is exported.

##### Control

> Information transfer rules, procedures, or agreements should be in
> place for all types of transfer facilities within the organization and
> between the organization and other parties.

##### Purpose

> To maintain the security of information transferred within an
> organization and with any external interested party.

##### Guidance

> [General]{.underline}
>
> The organization should establish and communicate a topic-specific
> policy on information transfer to all relevant interested parties.
> Rules, procedures and agreements to protect information in transit
> should reflect the classification of the information involved. Where
> information is transferred between the organization and third parties,
> transfer agreements (including recipient authentication) should be
> established and maintained to protect information in all forms in
> transit (see
> [[5.10]{.underline}](#acceptable-use-of-information-and-other-associated-assets)).
>
> Information transfer can happen through electronic transfer, physical
> storage media transfer and verbal transfer.
>
> For all types of information transfer, rules, procedures and
> agreements should include:

a)  controls designed to protect transferred information from
    interception, unauthorized access, copying, modification,
    misrouting, destruction and denial of service, including levels of
    access control commensurate with the classification of the
    information involved and any special controls that are required to
    protect sensitive information, such as use of cryptographic
    techniques (see [[8.24]{.underline}](#use-of-cryptography));

b)  controls to ensure traceability and non-repudiation, including
    > maintaining a chain of custody for information while in transit;

c)  identification of appropriate contacts related to the transfer
    > including information owners, risk owners, security officers and
    > information custodians, as applicable;

d)  responsibilities and liabilities in the event of information
    > security incidents, such as loss of physical storage media or
    > data;

e)  use of an agreed labelling system for sensitive or critical
    > information, ensuring that the meaning of the labels is
    > immediately understood and that the information is appropriately
    > protected (see [[5.13]{.underline}](#labelling-of-information));

f)  reliability and availability of the transfer service;

g)  the topic-specific policy or guidelines on acceptable use of
    > information transfer facilities (see
    > [[5.10]{.underline}](#acceptable-use-of-information-and-other-associated-assets));

h)  retention and disposal guidelines for all business records,
    > including messages;

> NOTE Local legislation and regulations can exist regarding retention
> and disposal of business records.

i)  the consideration of any other relevant legal, statutory, regulatory
    and contractual requirements (see
    [[5.31]{.underline}](#legal-statutory-regulatory-and-contractual-requirements),
    [[5.32]{.underline}](#intellectual-property-rights),
    [[5.33]{.underline}](#protection-of-records),
    [[5.34]{.underline}](#privacy-and-protection-of-pii)) related to
    transfer of information (e.g. requirements for electronic
    signatures).

> [Electronic transfer]{.underline}
>
> Rules, procedures and agreements should also consider the following
> items when using electronic communication facilities for information
> transfer:

a)  detection of and protection against malware that can be transmitted
    through the use of electronic communications (see
    [[8.7]{.underline}](#protection-against-malware));

b)  protection of communicated sensitive electronic information that is
    > in the form of an attachment;

c)  prevention against sending documents and messages in communications
    > to the wrong address or number;

d)  obtaining approval prior to using external public services such as
    > instant messaging, social networking, file sharing or cloud
    > storage;

e)  stronger levels of authentication when transferring information via
    > publicly accessible networks;

f)  restrictions associated with electronic communication facilities
    > (e.g. preventing automatic forwarding of electronic mail to
    > external mail addresses);

g)  advising personnel and other interested parties not to send short
    > message service (SMS) or instant messages with critical
    > information since these can be read in public places (and
    > therefore by unauthorized persons) or stored in devices not
    > adequately protected;

h)  advising personnel and other interested parties about the problems
    > of using fax machines or services, namely:

    1.  unauthorized access to built-in message stores to retrieve
        messages;

    2.  deliberate or accidental programming of machines to send
        > messages to specific numbers. [Physical storage media
        > transfer]{.underline}

> When transferring physical storage media (including paper), rules,
> procedures and agreements should also include:

a)  responsibilities for controlling and notifying transmission,
    dispatch and receipt;

b)  ensuring correct addressing and transportation of the message;

c)  packaging that protects the contents from any physical damage likely
    to arise during transit and in accordance with any manufacturers'
    specifications, for example protecting against any environmental
    factors that can reduce the effectiveness of restoring storage media
    such as exposure to heat, moisture or electromagnetic fields; using
    minimum technical standards for packaging and transmission (e.g. the
    use of opaque envelopes);

d)  a list of authorized reliable couriers agreed by management;

e)  courier identification standards;

f)  depending on the classification level of the information in the
    storage media to be transported, use tamper evident or
    tamper-resistant controls (e.g. bags, containers);

g)  procedures to verify the identification of couriers;

h)  approved list of third parties providing transportation or courier
    services depending on the classification of the information;

i)  keeping logs for identifying the content of the storage media, the
    protection applied as well as recording the list of authorised
    recipients, the times of transfer to the transit custodians and
    receipt at the destination.

> [Verbal transfer]{.underline}
>
> To protect verbal transfer of information, personnel and other
> interested parties should be reminded that they should:

a)  not have confidential verbal conversations in public places or over
    insecure communication channels since these can be overheard by
    unauthorized persons;

b)  not leave messages containing confidential information on answering
    machines or voice messages since these can be replayed by
    unauthorized persons, stored on communal systems or stored
    incorrectly as a result of misdialling;

c)  be screened to the appropriate level to listen to the conversation;

d)  ensure that appropriate room controls are implemented (e.g.
    > sound-proofing, closed door);

e)  begin any sensitive conversations with a disclaimer so those present
    > know the classification level and any handling requirements of
    > what they are about to hear.

##### Control

> Rules to control physical and logical access to information and other
> associated assets should be established and implemented based on
> business and information security requirements.

##### Purpose

> To ensure authorized access and to prevent unauthorized access to
> information and other associated assets.

##### Guidance

> Owners of information and other associated assets should determine
> information security and business requirements related to access
> control. A topic-specific policy on access control should be defined
> which takes account of these requirements and should be communicated
> to all relevant interested parties.
>
> These requirements and the topic-specific policy should consider the
> following:

a)  determining which entities require which type of access to the
    information and other associated assets;

b)  security of applications (see
    [[8.26]{.underline}](#application-security-requirements));

c)  physical access, which needs to be supported by appropriate physical
    > entry controls (see [[7.2]{.underline}](#physical-entry),
    > [[7.3]{.underline}](#securing-offices-rooms-and-facilities),
    > [[7.4]{.underline}](#physical-security-monitoring));

d)  information dissemination and authorization (e.g. the need-to-know
    > principle) and information security levels and classification of
    > information (see
    > [[5.10]{.underline}](#acceptable-use-of-information-and-other-associated-assets),
    > [[5.12]{.underline}](#classification-of-information),
    > [[5.13]{.underline}](#labelling-of-information));

e)  restrictions to privileged access (see
    > [[8.2]{.underline}](#privileged-access-rights));

f)  segregation of duties (see
    > [[5.3]{.underline}](#segregation-of-duties));

g)  relevant legislation, regulations and any contractual obligations
    > regarding limitation of access to data or services (see
    > [[5.31]{.underline}](#legal-statutory-regulatory-and-contractual-requirements),
    > [[5.32]{.underline}](#intellectual-property-rights),
    > [[5.33]{.underline}](#protection-of-records),
    > [[5.34]{.underline}](#privacy-and-protection-of-pii),
    > [[8.3]{.underline}](#information-access-restriction));

h)  segregation of access control functions (e.g. access request, access
    > authorization, access administration);

i)  formal authorization of access requests (see
    > [[5.16]{.underline}](#identity-management) and
    > [[5.18]{.underline}](#access-rights));

j)  the management of access rights (see
    > [[5.18]{.underline}](#access-rights));

k)  logging (see [[8.15]{.underline}](#logging)).

> Access control rules should be implemented by defining and mapping
> appropriate access rights and restrictions to the relevant entities
> (see [[5.16]{.underline}](#identity-management)). An entity can
> represent a human user as well as a technical or logical item (e.g. a
> machine, device or a service). To simplify the access control
> management, specific roles can be assigned to entity groups.
>
> The following should be taken into account when defining and
> implementing access control rules:

a)  consistency between the access rights and information
    classification;

b)  consistency between the access rights and the physical perimeter
    security needs and requirements;

c)  considering all types of available connections in distributed
    environments so entities are only provided with access to
    information and other associated assets, including networks and
    network services, that they are authorized to use;

d)  considering how elements or factors relevant to dynamic access
    > control can be reflected.

##### Other information

> There are often overarching principles used in the context of access
> control. Two of the most frequently used principles are:

a)  need-to-know: an entity is only granted access to the information
    which that entity requires in order to perform its tasks (different
    tasks or roles mean different need-to-know information and hence
    different access profiles);

b)  need-to-use: an entity is only assigned access to information
    technology infrastructure where a clear need is present.

> Care should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider:

a)  establishing rules based on the premise of least privilege,
    "Everything is generally forbidden unless expressly permitted",
    rather than the weaker rule, "Everything is generally permitted
    unless expressly forbidden";

b)  changes in information labels (see
    [[5.13]{.underline}](#labelling-of-information)) that are initiated
    automatically by information processing facilities and those
    initiated at the discretion of a user;

c)  changes in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the
    information system and those initiated by an administrator;

d)  when to define and regularly review the approval.

> Access control rules should be supported by documented procedures (see
> [[5.16]{.underline}](#identity-management),
> [[5.17]{.underline}](#authentication-information),
> [[5.18]{.underline}](#access-rights),
> [[8.2]{.underline}](#privileged-access-rights),
> [[8.3]{.underline}](#information-access-restriction),
> [[8.4]{.underline}](#access-to-source-code),
>
> [[8.5]{.underline}](#secure-authentication),
> [[8.18]{.underline}](#use-of-privileged-utility-programs)) and defined
> responsibilities (see
> [[5.2]{.underline}](#information-security-roles-and-responsibilities),
> [[5.17]{.underline}](#authentication-information)).
>
> There are several ways to implement access control, such as MAC
> (mandatory access control), DAC (discretionary access control), RBAC
> (role-based access control) and ABAC (attribute-based access control).
>
> Access control rules can also contain dynamic elements (e.g. a
> function that evaluates past accesses or specific environment values).
> Access control rules can be implemented in different granularity,
> ranging from covering whole networks or systems to specific data
> fields and can also consider properties such as user location or the
> type of network connection that is used for access. These principles
> and how granular access control is defined can have a significant cost
> impact. Stronger rules and more granularity typically lead to higher
> cost. Business requirements and risk considerations should be used to
> define which access control rules are applied and which granularity is
> required.

##### Control

> The full life cycle of identities should be managed.

##### Purpose

> To allow for the unique identification of individuals and systems
> accessing the organization's information and other associated assets
> and to enable appropriate assignment of access rights.

##### Guidance

> The processes used in the context of identity management should ensure
> that:

a)  for identities assigned to persons, a specific identity is only
    linked to a single person to be able to hold the person accountable
    for actions performed with this specific identity;

b)  identities assigned to multiple persons (e.g. shared identities) are
    only permitted where they are necessary for business or operational
    reasons and are subject to dedicated approval and documentation;

c)  identities assigned to non-human entities are subject to
    appropriately segregated approval and independent ongoing oversight;

d)  identities are disabled or removed in a timely fashion if they are
    no longer required (e.g. if their associated entities are deleted or
    no longer used, or if the person linked to an identity has left the
    organization or changed the role);

e)  in a specific domain, a single identity is mapped to a single
    entity, \[i.e. mapping of multiple identities to the same entity
    within the same context (duplicate identities) is avoided\];

f)  records of all significant events concerning the use and management
    of user identities and of authentication information are kept.

> The organization should have a supporting process in place to handle
> changes to information related to user identities. These processes can
> include re-verification of trusted documents related to a person.
>
> When using identities provided or issued by third parties (e.g. social
> media credentials), the organization should ensure the third-party
> identities provide the required trust level and any associated risks
> are known and sufficiently treated. This can include controls related
> to the third parties (see
> [[5.19]{.underline}](#information-security-in-supplier-relationships))
> as well as controls related to associated authentication information
> (see [[5.17]{.underline}](#authentication-information)).

##### Other information

> Providing or revoking access to information and other associated
> assets is usually a multi-step
>
> procedure:

a)  confirming the business requirements for an identity to be
    established;

b)  verifying the identity of an entity before allocating them a logical
    identity;

c)  establishing an identity;

d)  configuring and activating the identity. This also includes
    configuration and initial setup of related authentication services;

e)  providing or revoking specific access rights to the identity, based
    > on appropriate authorization or

> entitlement decisions (see [[5.18]{.underline}](#access-rights)).

##### Control

> Allocation and management of authentication information should be
> controlled by a management process, including advising personnel on
> the appropriate handling of authentication information.

##### Purpose

> To ensure proper entity authentication and prevent failures of
> authentication processes.

##### Guidance

> [Allocation of authentication information]{.underline}
>
> The allocation and management process should ensure that:

a)  personal passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs)
    generated automatically during enrolment processes as temporary
    secret authentication information are non-guessable and unique for
    each person, and that users are required to change them after the
    first use;

b)  procedures are established to verify the identity of a user prior to
    providing new, replacement or temporary authentication information;

c)  authentication information, including temporary authentication
    information, is transmitted to users in a secure manner (e.g. over
    an authenticated and protected channel) and the use of unprotected
    (clear text) electronic mail messages for this purpose is avoided;

d)  users acknowledge receipt of authentication information;

e)  default authentication information as predefined or provided by
    vendors is changed immediately following installation of systems or
    software;

f)  records of significant events concerning allocation and management
    of authentication information are kept and their confidentiality is
    granted, and that the record-keeping method is approved (e.g. by
    using an approved password vault tool).

> [User responsibilities]{.underline}
>
> Any person having access to or using authentication information should
> be advised to ensure that:

a)  secret authentication information such as passwords are kept
    confidential. Personal secret authentication information is not to
    be shared with anyone. Secret authentication information used in the
    context of identities linked to multiple users or linked to
    non-personal entities are solely shared with authorized persons;

b)  affected or compromised authentication information is changed
    immediately upon notification of or any other indication of a
    compromise;

c)  when passwords are used as authentication information, strong
    > passwords according to best practice recommendations are selected,
    > for example:

    1.  passwords are not based on anything somebody else can easily
        guess or obtain using person- related information (e.g. names,
        telephone numbers and dates of birth);

    2.  passwords are not based on dictionary words or combinations
        thereof;

    3.  use easy to remember passphrases and try to include
        alphanumerical and special characters;

    4.  passwords have a minimum length;

d)  the same passwords are not used across distinct services and
    > systems;

e)  the obligation to follow these rules is also included in terms and
    > conditions of employment (see

> [[6.2]{.underline}](#terms-and-conditions-of-employment)).
>
> [Password management system]{.underline}
>
> When passwords are used as authentication information, the password
> management system should:

a)  allow users to select and change their own passwords and include a
    confirmation procedure to address input errors;

b)  enforce strong passwords according to good practice recommendations
    \[see c) of \"User responsibilities\];

c)  force users to change their passwords at first login;

d)  enforce password changes as necessary, for example after a security
    incident, or upon termination or change of employment when a user
    has known passwords for identities that remain active (e.g. shared
    identities);

e)  prevent re-use of previous passwords;

f)  prevent the use of commonly-used passwords and compromised
    usernames, password combinations from hacked systems;

g)  not display passwords on the screen when being entered;

h)  store and transmit passwords in protected form.

> Password encryption and hashing should be performed according to
> approved cryptographic techniques for passwords (see
> [[8.24]{.underline}](#use-of-cryptography)).

##### Other information

> Passwords or passphrases are a commonly used type of authentication
> information and are a common means of verifying a user's identity.
> Other types of authentication information are cryptographic keys, data
> stored on hardware tokens (e.g. smart cards) that produce
> authentication codes and biometric data such as iris scans or
> fingerprints. Additional information can be found in the ISO/IEC 24760
> series.
>
> Requiring frequent change of passwords can be problematic because
> users can get annoyed by the frequent changes, forget new passwords,
> note them down in unsafe places, or choose unsafe passwords. Provision
> of single sign on (SSO) or other authentication management tools (e.g.
> password vaults) reduces the amount of authentication information that
> users are required to protect and can thereby increase the
> effectiveness of this control. However, these tools can also increase
> the impact of disclosure of authentication information.
>
> Some applications require user passwords to be assigned by an
> independent authority. In such cases, a),

c)  and d) of \"Password management system\" do not apply.

##### Control

> Access rights to information and other associated assets should be
> provisioned, reviewed, modified and removed in accordance with the
> organization's topic-specific policy on and rules for access control.

##### Purpose

> To ensure access to information and other associated assets is defined
> and authorized according to the business requirements.

##### Guidance

> [Provision and revocation of access rights]{.underline}
>
> The provisioning process for assigning or revoking physical and
> logical access rights granted to an entity's authenticated identity
> should include:

a)  obtaining authorization from the owner of the information and other
    associated assets for the use of the information and other
    associated assets (see
    [[5.9]{.underline}](#inventory-of-information-and-other-associated-assets)).
    Separate approval for access rights by management can also be
    appropriate;

b)  considering the business requirements and the organization's
    topic-specific policy and rules on access control;

c)  considering segregation of duties, including segregating the roles
    of approval and implementation of the access rights and separation
    of conflicting roles;

d)  ensuring access rights are removed when someone does not need to
    access the information and other associated assets, in particular
    ensuring access rights of users who have left the organization are
    removed in a timely fashion;

e)  considering giving temporary access rights for a limited time period
    and revoking them at the expiration date, in particular for
    temporary personnel or temporary access required by personnel;

f)  verifying that the level of access granted is in accordance with the
    topic-specific policies on access control (see
    [[5.15]{.underline}](#access-control)) and is consistent with other
    information security requirements such as segregation of duties (see
    [[5.3]{.underline}](#segregation-of-duties));

g)  ensuring that access rights are activated (e.g. by service
    providers) only after authorization procedures are successfully
    completed;

h)  maintaining a central record of access rights granted to a user
    identifier (ID, logical or physical) to access information and other
    associated assets;

i)  modifying access rights of users who have changed roles or jobs;

j)  removing or adjusting physical and logical access rights, which can
    be done by removal, revocation or replacement of keys,
    authentication information, identification cards or subscriptions;

k)  maintaining a record of changes to users' logical and physical
    > access rights. [Review of access rights]{.underline}

> Regular reviews of physical and logical access rights should consider
> the following:

a.  users' access rights after any change within the same organization
    (e.g. job change, promotion, demotion) or termination of employment
    (see [[6.1]{.underline}](#screening) to
    [[6.5]{.underline}](#responsibilities-after-termination-or-change-of-employment));

b.  authorizations for privileged access rights. [Consideration before
    > change or termination of employment]{.underline}

> A user's access rights to information and other associated assets
> should be reviewed and adjusted or removed before any change or
> termination of employment based on the evaluation of risk factors such
> as:

a)  whether the termination or change is initiated by the user or by
    management and the reason for termination;

b)  the current responsibilities of the user;

c)  the value of the assets currently accessible.

##### Other information

> Consideration should be given to establishing user access roles based
> on business requirements that summarize a number of access rights into
> typical user access profiles. Access requests and reviews of access
> rights are easier managed at the level of such roles than at the level
> of particular rights.
>
> Consideration should be given to including clauses in personnel
> contracts and service contracts that specify sanctions if unauthorized
> access is attempted by personnel (see
> [[5.20]{.underline}](#addressing-information-security-within-supplier-agreements),
> [[6.2]{.underline}](#terms-and-conditions-of-employment),
> [[6.4]{.underline}](#disciplinary-process),
> [[6.6]{.underline}](#confidentiality-or-non-disclosure-agreements)).
>
> In cases of management-initiated termination, disgruntled personnel or
> external party users can deliberately corrupt information or sabotage
> information processing facilities. In cases of persons resigning or
> being dismissed, they can be tempted to collect information for future
> use.
>
> Cloning is an efficient way for organizations to assign access to
> users. However, it should be done with care based on distinct roles
> identified by the organization rather than just cloning an identity
> with all associated access rights. Cloning has an inherent risk of
> resulting in excessive access rights to information and other
> associated assets.

>
> supplier to implement for the commencement of use of a supplier's
> products or services or for the termination of use of a supplier's
> products and services, such as:

a)  identifying and documenting the types of suppliers (e.g. ICT
    services, logistics, utilities, financial services, ICT
    infrastructure components) which can affect the confidentiality,
    integrity and availability of the organization\'s information;

b)  establishing how to evaluate and select suppliers according to the
    sensitivity of information, products and services (e.g. with market
    analysis, customer references, review of documents, on- site
    assessments, certifications);

c)  evaluating and selecting supplier's products or services that have
    adequate information security controls and reviewing them; in
    particular, accuracy and completeness of controls implemented by the
    supplier that ensure integrity of the supplier's information and
    information processing and hence the organization's information
    security;

d)  defining the organization's information, ICT services and the
    physical infrastructure that suppliers can access, monitor, control
    or use;

e)  defining the types of ICT infrastructure components and services
    provided by suppliers which can affect the confidentiality,
    integrity and availability of the organization\'s information;

f)  assessing and managing the information security risks associated
    with:

    1.  the suppliers' use of the organization's information and other
        associated assets, including risks originating from potential
        malicious supplier personnel;

    2.  malfunctioning or vulnerabilities of the products (including
        software components and sub- components used in these products)
        or services provided by the suppliers;

g)  monitoring compliance with established information security
    requirements for each type of supplier and type of access, including
    third-party review and product validation;

h)  mitigating non-compliance of a supplier, whether this was detected
    through monitoring or by other means;

i)  handling incidents and contingencies associated with supplier
    products and services including responsibilities of both the
    organization and suppliers;

j)  resilience and, if necessary, recovery and contingency measures to
    ensure the availability of the supplier's information and
    information processing and hence the availability of the
    organization's information;

k)  awareness and training for the organization's personnel interacting
    with supplier personnel regarding appropriate rules of engagement,
    topic-specific policies, processes and procedures and behaviour
    based on the type of supplier and the level of supplier access to
    the organization's systems and information;

l)  managing the necessary transfer of information, other associated
    assets and anything else that needs to be changed and ensuring that
    information security is maintained throughout the transfer period;

m)  requirements to ensure a secure termination of the supplier
    > relationship, including:

    1.  de-provisioning of access rights;

    2.  information handling;

    3.  determining ownership of intellectual property developed during
        the engagement;

    4.  information portability in case of change of supplier or
        insourcing;

```{=html}

```
6)  records management;

7)  return of assets;

8)  secure disposal of information and other associated assets;

9)  ongoing confidentiality requirements;

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
n)  level of personnel security and physical security expected from
    > supplier\'s personnel and facilities.

> The procedures for continuing information processing in the event that
> the supplier becomes unable to supply its products or services (e.g.
> because of an incident, because the supplier is no longer in business,
> or no longer provides some components due to technology advancements)
> should be considered to avoid any delay in arranging replacement
> products or services (e.g. identifying an alternative supplier in
> advance or always using alternative suppliers).

##### Other information

> In cases where it is not possible for an organization to place
> requirements on a supplier, the organization
>
> should:

a)  consider the guidance given in this control in making decisions
    about choosing a supplier and its product or service;

b)  implement compensating controls as necessary based on a risk
    assessment.

> Information can be put at risk by suppliers with inadequate
> information security management. Controls should be determined and
> applied to manage the supplier\'s access to information and other
> associated assets. For example, if there is a special need for
> confidentiality of the information, non-disclosure agreements or
> cryptographic techniques can be used. Another example is personal data
> protection risks when the supplier agreement involves transfer of, or
> access to, information across borders. The organization needs to be
> aware that the legal or contractual responsibility for protecting
> information remains with the organization.
>
> Risks can also be caused by inadequate controls of ICT infrastructure
> components or services provided by suppliers. Malfunctioning or
> vulnerable components or services can cause information security
> breaches in the organization or to another entity (e.g. they can cause
> malware infection, attacks or other harm on entities other than the
> organization).

##### Control

> Processes and procedures should be defined and implemented to manage
> the information security risks associated with the ICT products and
> services supply chain.

##### Purpose

> To maintain an agreed level of information security in supplier
> relationships.

##### Guidance

> The following topics should be considered to address information
> security within ICT supply chain security in addition to the general
> information security requirements for supplier relationships:

a)  defining information security requirements to apply to ICT product
    or service acquisition;

b)  requiring that ICT services suppliers propagate the organization's
    security requirements throughout the supply chain if they
    sub-contract for parts of the ICT service provided to the
    organization;

c)  requiring that ICT products suppliers propagate appropriate security
    practices throughout the supply chain if these products include
    components purchased or acquired from other suppliers or other
    entities (e.g. sub-contracted software developers and hardware
    component providers);

d)  requesting that ICT products suppliers provide information
    describing the software components used in products;

e)  requesting that ICT products suppliers provide information
    describing the implemented security functions of their product and
    the configuration required for its secure operation;

f)  implementing a monitoring process and acceptable methods for
    validating that delivered ICT products and services comply with
    stated security requirements. Examples of such supplier review
    methods can include penetration testing and proof or validation of
    third-party attestations for the supplier's information security
    operations;

g)  implementing a process for identifying and documenting product or
    service components that are critical for maintaining functionality
    and therefore require increased attention, scrutiny and further
    follow up required when built outside of the organization especially
    if the supplier outsources aspects of product or service components
    to other suppliers;

h)  obtaining assurance that critical components and their origin can be
    traced throughout the supply chain;

i)  obtaining assurance that the delivered ICT products are functioning
    as expected without any unexpected or unwanted features;

j)  implementing processes to ensure that components from suppliers are
    genuine and unaltered from their specification. Example measures
    include anti-tamper labels, cryptographic hash verifications or
    digital signatures. Monitoring for out of specification performance
    can be an indicator of tampering or counterfeits. Prevention and
    detection of tampering should be implemented during multiple stages
    in the system development life cycle, including design, development,
    integration, operations and maintenance;

k)  obtaining assurance that ICT products achieve required security
    levels, for example, through formal certification or an evaluation
    scheme such as the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement;

l)  defining rules for sharing of information regarding the supply chain
    and any potential issues and compromises among the organization and
    suppliers;

m)  implementing specific processes for managing ICT component life
    cycle and availability and associated security risks. This includes
    managing the risks of components no longer being available due to
    suppliers no longer being in business or suppliers no longer
    providing these components due to technology advancements.
    Identification of an alternative supplier and the process to
    transfer software and competence to the alternative supplier should
    be considered.

##### Other information

> The specific ICT supply chain risk management practices are built on
> top of general information security, quality, project management and
> system engineering practices but do not replace them.
>
> Organizations are advised to work with suppliers to understand the ICT
> supply chain and any matters that have an important effect on the
> products and services being provided. The organization can influence
> ICT supply chain information security practices by making clear in
> agreements with their suppliers the matters that should be addressed
> by other suppliers in the ICT supply chain.
>
> ICT should be acquired from reputable sources. The reliability of
> software and hardware is a matter of quality control. While it is
> generally not possible for an organization to inspect the quality
> control systems of its vendors, it can make reliable judgments based
> on the reputation of the vendor.
>
> ICT supply chain as addressed here includes cloud services. Examples
> of ICT supply chains are:

a.  cloud services provisioning, where the cloud service provider relies
    on the software developers, telecommunication service providers,
    hardware providers;

b.  IoT, where the service involves the device manufacturers, the cloud
    service providers (e.g. the IoT platform operators), the developers
    for mobile and web applications, the vendor of software libraries;

c.  hosting services, where the provider relies on external service
    desks including first, second and

> third support levels.
>
> See ISO/IEC 27036-3 for more details including risk assessment
> guidance.
>
> Software identification (SWID) tags can also help to achieve better
> information security in the supply chain, by providing information
> about software provenance. See ISO/IEC 19770-2 for more details.

##### Control

> Processes for acquisition, use, management and exit from cloud
> services should be established in accordance with the organization's
> information security requirements.

##### Purpose

> To specify and manage information security for the use of cloud
> services.

##### Guidance

> The organization should establish and communicate topic-specific
> policy on the use of cloud services to all relevant interested
> parties.
>
> The organization should define and communicate how it intends to
> manage information security risks associated with the use of cloud
> services. It can be an extension or part of the existing approach for
> how an organization manages services provided by external parties (see
> [[5.21]{.underline}](#managing-information-security-in-the-ict-supply-chain)
> and
> [[5.22]{.underline}](#monitoring-review-and-change-management-of-supplier-services)).
>
> The use of cloud services can involve shared responsibility for
> information security and collaborative effort between the cloud
> service provider and the organization acting as the cloud service
> customer. It is essential that the responsibilities for both the cloud
> service provider and the organization, acting as the cloud service
> customer, are defined and implemented appropriately.
>
> The organization should define:

a)  all relevant information security requirements associated with the
    use of the cloud services;

b)  cloud service selection criteria and scope of cloud service usage;

c)  roles and responsibilities related to the use and management of
    cloud services;

d)  which information security controls are managed by the cloud service
    provider and which are managed by the organization as the cloud
    service customer;

e)  how to obtain and utilize information security capabilities provided
    by the cloud service provider;

f)  how to obtain assurance on information security controls implemented
    by cloud service providers;

g)  how to manage controls, interfaces and changes in services when an
    organization uses multiple cloud services, particularly from
    different cloud service providers;

h)  procedures for handling information security incidents that occur in
    relation to the use of cloud services;

i)  its approach for monitoring, reviewing and evaluating the ongoing
    use of cloud services to manage information security risks;

j)  how to change or stop the use of cloud services including exit
    strategies for cloud services.

> Cloud service agreements are often pre-defined and not open to
> negotiation. For all cloud services, the organization should review
> cloud service agreements with the cloud service provider(s). A cloud
> service agreement should address the confidentiality, integrity,
> availability and information handling requirements of the
> organization, with appropriate cloud service level objectives and
> cloud service qualitative objectives. The organization should also
> undertake relevant risk assessments to identify
>
> the risks associated with using the cloud service. Any residual risks
> connected to the use of the cloud service should be clearly identified
> and accepted by the appropriate management of the organization.
>
> An agreement between the cloud service provider and the organization,
> acting as the cloud service customer, should include the following
> provisions for the protection of the organization's data and
> availability of services:

a)  providing solutions based on industry accepted standards for
    architecture and infrastructure;

b)  managing access controls of the cloud service to meet the
    requirements of the organization;

c)  implementing malware monitoring and protection solutions;

d)  processing and storing the organization's sensitive information in
    approved locations (e.g. particular country or region) or within or
    subject to a particular jurisdiction;

e)  providing dedicated support in the event of an information security
    incident in the cloud service environment;

f)  ensuring that the organization's information security requirements
    are met in the event of cloud services being further sub-contracted
    to an external supplier (or prohibiting cloud services from being
    sub-contracted);

g)  supporting the organization in gathering digital evidence, taking
    into consideration laws and regulations for digital evidence across
    different jurisdictions;

h)  providing appropriate support and availability of services for an
    appropriate time frame when the organization wants to exit from the
    cloud service;

i)  providing required backup of data and configuration information and
    securely managing backups as applicable, based on the capabilities
    of the cloud service provider used by the organization, acting as
    the cloud service customer;

j)  providing and returning information such as configuration files,
    source code and data that are owned by the organization, acting as
    the cloud service customer, when requested during the service
    provision or at termination of service.

> The organization, acting as the cloud service customer, should
> consider whether the agreement should require cloud service providers
> to provide advance notification prior to any substantive customer
> impacting changes being made to the way the service is delivered to
> the organization, including:

a)  changes to the technical infrastructure (e.g. relocation,
    reconfiguration, or changes in hardware or software) that affect or
    change the cloud service offering;

b)  processing or storing information in a new geographical or legal
    jurisdiction;

c)  use of peer cloud service providers or other sub-contractors
    (including changing existing or using new parties).

> The organization using cloud services should maintain close contact
> with its cloud service providers. These contacts enable mutual
> exchange of information about information security for the use of the
> cloud services including a mechanism for both cloud service provider
> and the organization, acting as the cloud service customer, to monitor
> each service characteristic and report failures to the commitments
> contained in the agreements.

>
> Management should ensure that an information security incident
> management plan is created considering different scenarios and
> procedures are developed and implemented for the following activities:

a)  evaluation of information security events according to criteria for
    what constitutes an information security incident;

b)  monitoring (see [[8.15]{.underline}](#logging) and
    [[8.16]{.underline}](#monitoring-activities)), detecting (see
    [[8.16]{.underline}](#monitoring-activities)), classifying (see
    [[5.25]{.underline}](#assessment-and-decision-on-information-security-events)),
    analysing and reporting

> (see [[6.8]{.underline}](#information-security-event-reporting)) of
> information security events and incidents (by human or automatic
> means);

c)  managing information security incidents to conclusion, including
    response and escalation (see
    [[5.26]{.underline}](#response-to-information-security-incidents)),
    according to the type and the category of the incident, possible
    activation of crisis management and activation of continuity plans,
    controlled recovery from an incident and communication to internal
    and external interested parties;

d)  coordination with internal and external interested parties such as
    authorities, external interest groups and forums, suppliers and
    clients (see [[5.5]{.underline}](#contact-with-authorities) and
    [[5.6]{.underline}](#contact-with-special-interest-groups));

e)  logging incident management activities;

f)  handling of evidence (see
    [[5.28]{.underline}](#collection-of-evidence));

g)  root cause analysis or post-mortem procedures;

h)  identification of lessons learned and any improvements to the
    incident management procedures or information security controls in
    general that are required.

> [Reporting procedures]{.underline}
>
> Reporting procedures should include:

a)  actions to be taken in case of an information security event (e.g.
    noting all pertinent details immediately such as malfunction
    occurring and messages on screen, immediately reporting to the point
    of contact and only taking coordinated actions);

b)  use of incident forms to support personnel to perform all necessary
    actions when reporting information security incidents;

c)  suitable feedback processes to ensure that those persons reporting
    information security events are notified, to the extent possible, of
    outcomes after the issue has been addressed and closed;

d)  creation of incident reports.

> Any external requirements on reporting of incidents to relevant
> interested parties within the defined time frame (e.g. breach
> notification requirements to regulators) should be considered when
> implementing incident management procedures.

##### Other information

> Information security incidents can transcend organizational and
> national boundaries. To respond to such incidents, it is beneficial to

##### Control

> The organization should establish and implement procedures for the
> identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of evidence
> related to information security events.

##### Purpose

> To ensure a consistent and effective management of evidence related to
> information security incidents for the purposes of disciplinary and
> legal actions.

##### Guidance

> Internal procedures should be developed and followed when dealing with
> evidence related to information security events for the purposes of
> disciplinary and legal actions. The requirements of different
> jurisdictions should be considered to maximize chances of admission
> across the relevant jurisdictions.
>
> In general, these procedures for the management of evidence should
> provide instructions for the identification, collection, acquisition
> and preservation of evidence in accordance with different types of
> storage media, devices and status of devices (i.e. powered on or off).
> Evidence typically needs to be collected in a manner that is
> admissible in the appropriate national courts of law or another
> disciplinary forum. It should be possible to show that:

a)  records are complete and have not been tampered with in any way;

b)  copies of electronic evidence are probably identical to the
    originals;

c)  any information system from which evidence has been gathered was
    operating correctly at the time the evidence was recorded.

> Where available, certification or other relevant means of
> qualification of personnel and tools should be sought, so as to
> strengthen the value of the preserved evidence.
>
> Digital evidence can transcend organizational or jurisdictional
> boundaries. In such cases, it should be ensured that the organization
> is entitled to collect the required information as digital evidence.

##### Other information

> When an information security event is first detected, it is not always
> obvious whether or not the event will result in court action.
> Therefore, the danger exists that necessary evidence is destroyed
> intentionally or accidentally before the seriousness of the incident
> is realized. It is advisable to involve legal advice or law
> enforcement early in any contemplated legal action and take advice on
> the evidence required.
>
> ISO/IEC 27037 provides definitions and guidelines for identification,
> collection, acquisition and preservation of digital evidence.
>
> The ISO/IEC 27050 series deals with electronic discovery, which
> involves the processing of electronically stored information as
> evidence.

##### Guidance

> ICT readiness for business continuity is an important component in
> business continuity management and information security management to
> ensure that the organization's objectives can continue to be met
> during disruption.
>
> The ICT continuity requirements are the outcome of the business impact
> analysis (BIA). The BIA process should use impact types and criteria
> to assess the impacts over time resulting from the disruption of
> business activities that deliver products and services. The magnitude
> and duration of the resulting impact should be used to identify
> prioritized activities which should be assigned a recovery time
> objective (RTO). The BIA should then determine which resources are
> needed to support prioritized activities. An RTO should also be
> specified for these resources. A subset of these resources should
> include ICT services.
>
> The BIA involving ICT services can be expanded to define performance
> and capacity requirements of ICT systems and recovery point objectives
> (RPO) of information required to support activities during disruption.
>
> Based on the outputs from the BIA and risk assessment involving ICT
> services, the organization should identify and select ICT continuity
> strategies that consider options for before, during and after
> disruption. The business continuity strategies can comprise one or
> more solutions. Based on the strategies, plans should be developed,
> implemented and tested to meet the required availability level of ICT
> services and in the required time frames following interruption to, or
> failure of, critical processes.
>
> The organization should ensure that:

a)  an adequate organizational structure is in place to prepare for,
    mitigate and respond to a disruption supported by personnel with the
    necessary responsibility, authority and competence;

b)  ICT continuity plans, including response and recovery procedures
    detailing how the organization is planning to manage an ICT service
    disruption, are:

    1.  regularly evaluated through exercises and tests;

    2.  approved by management;

c)  ICT continuity plans include the following ICT continuity
    information:

    1.  performance and capacity specifications to meet the business
        continuity requirements and objectives as specified in the BIA;

    2.  RTO of each prioritized ICT service and the procedures for
        restoring those components;

    3.  RPO of the prioritized ICT resources defined as information and
        the procedures for restoring the information.

##### Other information

> Managing ICT continuity forms a key part of business continuity
> requirements concerning availability to be able to:

a)  respond and recover from disruption to ICT services regardless of
    the cause;

b)  ensure continuity of prioritized activities are supported by the
    required ICT services;

c)  respond before a disruption to ICT services occurs, and upon
    detection of at least one incident that can result in a disruption
    to ICT services.

##### Purpose

> To ensure compliance with legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual

##### Guidance

> The organization should take the following steps to protect the
> authenticity, reliability, integrity and usability of records, as
> their business context and requirements for their management change
> over time:

a)  issue guidelines on the storage, handling chain of custody and
    disposal of records, which includes prevention of manipulation of
    records. These guidelines should be aligned with the organization's
    topic-specific policy on records management and other records
    requirements;

b)  draw up a retention schedule defining records and the period of time
    for which they should be retained.

> The system of storage and handling should ensure identification of
> records and of their retention period taking into consideration
> national or regional legislation or regulations, as well as community
> or societal expectations, if applicable. This system should permit
> appropriate destruction of records after that period if they are not
> needed by the organization.
>
> When deciding on protection of specific organizational records, their
> corresponding information security classification, based on the
> organization's classification scheme, should be considered. Records
> should be categorized into record types (e.g. accounting records,
> business transaction records, personnel records, legal records), each
> with details of retention periods and type of allowable storage media
> which can be physical or electronic.
>
> Data storage systems should be chosen such that required records can
> be retrieved in an acceptable time frame and format, depending on the
> requirements to be fulfilled.
>
> Where electronic storage media are chosen, procedures to ensure the
> ability to access records (both storage media and format readability)
> throughout the retention period should be established to safeguard
> against loss due to future technology change. Any related
> cryptographic keys and programs associated with encrypted archives or
> digital signatures, should also be retained to enable decryption of
> the records for the length of time the records are retained (see
> [[8.24]{.underline}](#use-of-cryptography)).
>
> Storage and handling procedures should be implemented in accordance

##### Control

> The organization's approach to managing information security and its
> implementation including people, processes and technologies should be
> reviewed independently at planned intervals, or when significant
> changes occur.

##### Purpose

> To ensure the continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of
> the organization's approach to managing information security.

##### Guidance

> The organization should have processes to conduct independent reviews.
>
> Management should plan and initiate periodic independent reviews. The
> reviews should include assessing opportunities for improvement and the
> need for changes to the approach to information security, including
> the information security policy, topic-specific policies and other
> controls.
>
> Such reviews should be carried out by individuals independent of the
> area under review (e.g. the internal audit function, an independent
> manager or an external party organization specializing in such
> reviews). Individuals carrying out these reviews should have the
> appropriate competence. The person conducting the reviews should not
> be in the line of authority to ensure they have the independence to
> make an assessment.
>
> The results of the independent reviews should be reported to the
> management who initiated the reviews and, if appropriate, to top
> management. These records should be maintained.
>
> If the independent reviews identify that the organization's approach
> and implementation to managing information security is inadequate
> \[e.g. documented objectives and requirements are not met or are not
> compliant with the direction for information security stated in the
> information security policy and topic-specific policies (see
> [[5.1]{.underline}](#policies-for-information-security))\], management
> should initiate corrective actions.
>
> In addition to the periodic independent reviews, the organization
> should consider conducting
>
> independent reviews when:

a)  laws and regulations which affect the organization change;

b)  significant incidents occur;

c)  the organization starts a new business or changes a current
    business;

d)  the organization starts to use a new product or service, or changes
    the use of a current product or service;

e)  the organization changes the information security controls and
    procedures significantly.

> reviewed.

##### Purpose

> To ensure that information security is implemented and operated in
> accordance with the organization's information security policy,
> topic-specific policies, rules and standards.

##### Guidance

> Managers, service, product or information owners should identify how
> to review that information security requirements defined in the
> information security policy, topic-specific policies, rules, standards
> and other applicable regulations are met. Automatic measurement and
> reporting tools should be considered for efficient regular review.
>
> If any non-compliance is found as a result of the review, managers
> should:

a)  identify the causes of the non-compliance;

b)  evaluate the need for corrective actions to achieve compliance;

c)  implement appropriate corrective actions;

d)  review corrective actions taken to verify its effectiveness and
    identify any deficiencies or weaknesses.

> Results of reviews and corrective actions carried out by managers,
> service, product or information owners should be recorded and these
> records should be maintained. Managers should report the results to
> the persons carrying out independent reviews (see
> [[5.35]{.underline}](#independent-review-of-information-security))
> when an independent review takes place in the area of their
> responsibility.
>
> Corrective actions should be completed in a timely manner as

##### Purpose

> To ensure all personnel are eligible and suitable for the roles for
> which they are considered and remain eligible and suitable during
> their employment.

##### Guidance

> A screening process should be performed for all personnel including
> full-time, part-time and temporary staff. Where these individuals are
> contracted through suppliers of services, screening requirements
> should be included in the contractual agreements between the
> organization and the suppliers.
>
> Information on all candidates being considered for positions within
> the organization should be collected and handled taking into
> consideration any appropriate legislation existing in the relevant
> jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, the organization can be legally
> required to inform the candidates beforehand about the screening
> activities.
>
> Verification should take into consideration all relevant privacy, PII
> protection and employment-based legislation and should, where
> permitted, include the following:

a)  availability of satisfactory references (e.g. business and personal
    references);

b)  a verification (for completeness and accuracy) of the applicant's
    curriculum vitae;

c)  confirmation of claimed academic and professional qualifications;

d)  independent identity verification (e.g. passport or other acceptable
    document issued by appropriate authorities);

e)  more detailed verification, such as credit review or review of
    > criminal records if the candidate takes on a critical role.

> When an individual is hired for a specific information security role,
> the organization should make sure the candidate:

a)  has the necessary competence to perform the security role;

b)  can be trusted to take on the role, especially if the role is
    critical for the organization.

> Where a job, either on initial appointment or on promotion, involves
> the person having access to information processing facilities and, in
> particular, if these involve handling confidential information (e.g.
> financial information, personal information or health care
> information) the organization should also consider further, more
> detailed verifications.
>
> Procedures should define criteria and limitations for verification
> reviews (e.g. who is eligible to screen people and how, when and why
> verification reviews are carried out).
>
> In situations where verification cannot be completed in a timely
> manner, mitigating controls should be implemented until the review has
> been finished, for example:

a)  delayed onboarding;

b)  delayed deployment of corporate assets;

c)  onboarding with reduced access;

d)  termination of employment.

> Verification checks should be repeated periodically to confirm ongoing
> suitability of personnel, depending on the criticality of a person's
> role.

d)  responsibilities for the handling of information received from
    > interested parties;

e)  actions to be taken if personnel disregard the organization's
    security requirements (see
    [[6.4]{.underline}](#disciplinary-process)).

> Information security roles and responsibilities should be communicated

##### Control

> Personnel of the organization and relevant interested parties should
> receive appropriate information security awareness, education and
> training and regular updates of the organization\'s information
> security policy, topic-specific policies and procedures, as relevant
> for their job function.

##### Purpose

> To ensure personnel and relevant interested parties are aware of and
> fulfil their information security
>
> responsibilities. **Guidance** [General]{.underline}
>
> An information security awareness, education and training programme
> should be established in line with the organization's information
> security policy, topic-specific policies and relevant procedures on
> information security, taking into consideration the organization's
> information to be protected and the information security controls that
> have been implemented to protect the information.
>
> Information security awareness, education and training should take
> place periodically. Initial awareness, education and training can
> apply to new personnel and to those who transfer to new positions or
> roles with substantially different information security requirements.
>
> Personnel's understanding should be assessed at the end of an
> awareness, education or training activity to test knowledge transfer
> and the effectiveness of the awareness, education and training
> programme.
>
> [Awareness]{.underline}
>
> An information security awareness programme should aim to make
> personnel aware of their responsibilities for information security and
> the means by which those responsibilities are discharged.
>
> The awareness programme should be planned taking into consideration
> the roles of personnel in the organization, including internal and
> external personnel (e.g. external consultants, supplier personnel).
> The activities in the awareness programme should be scheduled over
> time, preferably regularly, so that the activities are repeated and
> cover new personnel. It should also be built on lessons learnt from
> information security incidents.
>
> The awareness programme should include a number of awareness-raising
> activities via appropriate physical or virtual channels such as
> campaigns, booklets, posters, newsletters, websites, information
> sessions, briefings, e-learning modules and e-mails.
>
> Information security awareness should cover general aspects such as:

a)  management's commitment to information security throughout the
    organization;

b)  familiarity and compliance needs concerning applicable information
    security rules and obligations, taking into account information
    security policy and topic-specific policies, standards, laws,
    statutes, regulations, contracts and agreements;

c)  personal accountability for one's own actions and inactions, and
    general responsibilities towards securing or protecting information
    belonging to the organization and interested parties;

d)  basic information security procedures \[e.g. information security
    event reporting
    ([[6.8]{.underline}](#information-security-event-reporting))\] and
    baseline controls \[e.g. password security
    ([[5.17]{.underline}](#authentication-information))\];

e)  contact points and resources for additional information and advice
    > on information security matters, including further information
    > security awareness materials.

> [Education and training]{.underline}
>
> The organization should identify, prepare and implement an appropriate
> training plan for technical teams whose roles require specific skill
> sets and expertise. Technical teams should have the skills for
> configuring and maintaining the required security level for devices,
> systems, applications and services. If there are missing skills, the
> organization should take action and acquire them.
>
> The education and training programme should consider different forms
> \[e.g. lectures or self-studies, being mentored by expert staff or
> consultants (on-the-job training), rotating staff members to follow
> different activities, recruiting already skilled people and hiring
> consultants\]. It can use different means
>
> of delivery including classroom-based, distance learning, web-based,
> self-paced and others. Technical personnel should keep their knowledge
> up to date by subscribing to newsletters and magazines or by attending
> conferences and events aimed at technical and professional
> improvement.

##### Other information

> When composing an awareness programme, it is important not only to
> focus on the 'what' and 'how', but also the 'why', when possible. It
> is important that personnel understand the aim of information security
> and the potential effect, positive and negative, on the organization
> of their own behaviour.
>
> Information security awareness, education and training can be part of,
> or conducted in collaboration with, other activities, for example
> general information management, ICT, security, privacy or safety
> training.

##### Control

> A disciplinary process should be formalized and communicated to take
> actions against personnel and other relevant interested parties who
> have committed an information security policy violation.

##### Purpose

> To ensure personnel and other relevant interested parties understand
> the consequences of information security policy violation, to deter
> and appropriately deal with personnel and other relevant interested
> parties who committed the violation.

##### Guidance

> The disciplinary process should not be initiated without prior
> verification that an information security policy violation has
> occurred (see [[5.28]{.underline}](#collection-of-evidence)).
>
> The formal disciplinary process should provide for a graduated
> response that takes into consideration factors such as:

a)  the nature (who, what, when, how) and gravity of the breach and its
    consequences;

b)  whether the offence was intentional (malicious) or unintentional
    (accidental);

c)  whether or not this is a first or repeated offence;

d)  whether or not the violator was properly trained.

> The response should take into consideration relevant legal, statutory,
> regulatory contractual and business requirements as well as other
> factors as required. The disciplinary process should also be used as a
> deterrent to prevent personnel and other relevant interested parties
> from violating the information security policy, topic-specific
> policies and procedures for information security. Deliberate
> information security policy violations can require immediate actions.

##### Other information

> Where possible, the identity of individuals subject to disciplinary
> action should be protected in line with applicable requirements.
>
> When individuals demonstrate excellent behaviour with regard to
> information security, they can be rewarded to promote information
> security and encourage good behaviour.

##### Control

> Information security responsibilities and duties that remain valid
> after termination or change of employment should be defined, enforced
> and communicated to relevant personnel and other interested parties.

##### Purpose

> To protect the organization's interests as part of the process of
> changing or terminating employment or contracts.

##### Guidance

> The process for managing termination or change of employment should
> define which information security responsibilities and duties should
> remain valid after termination or change. This can include
> confidentiality of information, intellectual property and other
> knowledge obtained, as well as responsibilities contained within any
> other confidentiality agreement (see
> [[6.6]{.underline}](#confidentiality-or-non-disclosure-agreements)).
> Responsibilities and duties still valid after termination of
> employment or contract should be contained in the individual's terms
> and conditions of employment (see
> [[6.2]{.underline}](#terms-and-conditions-of-employment)), contract or
> agreement. Other contracts or agreements that continue for a defined
> period after the end of the individual's employment can also contain
> information security responsibilities.
>
> Changes of responsibility or employment should be managed as the
> termination of the current responsibility or employment combined with
> the initiation of the new responsibility or employment.
>
> Information security roles and responsibilities held by any individual
> who leaves or changes job roles should be identified and transferred
> to another individual.
>
> A process should be established for the communication of the changes
> and of operating procedures to personnel, other interested parties and
> relevant contact persons (e.g. to customers and suppliers).
>
> The process for the termination or change of employment should also be
> applied to external personnel (i.e. suppliers) when a termination
> occurs of personnel, the contract or the job with the organization, or
> when there is a change of the job within the organization.

##### Other information

> In many organizations, the human resources function is generally
> responsible for the overall termination process and works together
> with the supervising manager of the person transitioning to manage the
> information security aspects of the relevant procedures. In the case
> of personnel provided through an external party (e.g. through a
> supplier), this termination process is undertaken by the external
> party in accordance with the contract between the organization and the
> external party.

> identified, documented, regularly reviewed and signed by personnel and
> other relevant interested parties.

##### Purpose

> To maintain confidentiality of information accessible by personnel or

##### Guidance

> Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements should address the
> requirement to protect confidential information using legally
> enforceable terms. Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements are
> applicable to interested parties and personnel of the organization.
> Based on an organization's information security requirements, the
> terms in the agreements should be determined by taking into
> consideration the type of information that will be handled, its
> classification level, its use and the permissible access by the other
> party. To identify requirements for confidentiality or non-disclosure
> agreements, the following elements should be considered:

a)  a definition of the information to be protected (e.g. confidential
    information);

b)  the expected duration of an agreement, including cases where it can
    be necessary to maintain confidentiality indefinitely or until the
    information becomes publicly available;

c)  the required actions when an agreement is terminated;

d)  the responsibilities and actions of signatories to avoid
    > unauthorized information disclosure;

e)  the ownership of information, trade secrets and intellectual
    property, and how this relates to the protection of confidential
    information;

f)  the permitted use of confidential information and rights of the
    signatory to use the information;

g)  the right to audit and monitor activities that involve confidential
    information for highly sensitive circumstances;

h)  the process for notification and reporting of unauthorized
    disclosure or confidential information leakage;

i)  the terms for information to be returned or destroyed at agreement
    termination;

j)  the expected actions to be taken in the case of non-compliance with
    the agreement.

> The organization should take into consideration the compliance with
> confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements for the jurisdiction to
> which they apply (see
> [[5.31]{.underline}](#legal-statutory-regulatory-and-contractual-requirements),
> [[5.32]{.underline}](#intellectual-property-rights),

##### Control

> Security measures should be implemented when personnel are working
> remotely to protect information accessed, processed or stored outside
> the organization's premises.

##### Purpose

> To ensure the security of information when personnel are working
> remotely.

##### Guidance

> Remote working occurs whenever personnel of the organization work from
> a location outside of the organization's premises, accessing
> information whether in hardcopy or electronically via ICT equipment.
> Remote working environments include those referred to as
> "teleworking", "telecommuting", "flexible workplace", "virtual work
> environments\" and "remote maintenance".
>
> NOTE It is possible that not all the recommendations in this guidance
> can be applied due to local legislation and regulations in different
> jurisdictions.
>
> Organizations allowing remote working activities should issue a
> topic-specific policy on remote working that defines the relevant
> conditions and restrictions. Where deemed applicable, the following
> matters should be considered:

a)  the existing or proposed physical security of the remote working
    site, taking into account the physical security of the location and
    the local environment, including the different jurisdictions where
    personnel are located;

b)  rules and security mechanisms for the remote physical environment
    such as lockable filing cabinets, secure transportation between
    locations and rules for remote access, clear desk, printing and
    disposal of information and other associated assets, and information
    security event reporting (see
    [[6.8]{.underline}](#information-security-event-reporting));

c)  the expected physical remote working environments;

d)  the communications security requirements, taking into account the
    need for remote access to the organization's systems, the
    sensitivity of the information to be accessed and passed over the
    communication link and the sensitivity of the systems and
    applications;

e)  the use of remote access such as virtual desktop access that
    supports processing and storage of information on privately owned
    equipment;

f)  the threat of unauthorized access to information or resources from
    other persons at the remote working site (e.g. family and friends);

g)  the threat of unauthorized access to information or resources from
    other persons in public places;

h)  the use of home networks and public networks, and requirements or
    restrictions on the configuration of wireless network services;

i)  use of security measures, such as firewalls and protection against
    malware;

j)  secure mechanisms for deploying and initializing systems remotely;

k)  secure mechanisms for authentication and enablement of access
    > privileges taking into consideration the vulnerability of
    > single-factor authentication mechanisms where remote access to the
    > organization's network is allowed.

> The guidelines and measures to be considered should include:

a)  the provision of suitable equipment and storage furniture for the
    remote working activities, where the use of privately-owned
    equipment that is not under the control of the organization is not
    allowed;

b)  a definition of the work permitted, the classification of
    information that can be held and the internal systems and services
    that the remote worker is authorized to access;

c)  the provision of training for those working remotely and those
    providing support. This should include how to conduct business in a
    secure manner while working remotely;

d)  the provision of suitable communication equipment, including methods
    for securing remote access, such as requirements on device screen
    locks and inactivity timers; the enabling of device location
    tracking; installation of remote wipe capabilities;

e)  physical security;

f)  rules and guidance on family and visitor access to equipment and
    information;

g)  the provision of hardware and software support and maintenance;

h)  the provision of insurance;

i)  the procedures for backup and business continuity;

j)  audit and security monitoring;

k)  revocation of authority and access rights and the return of
    equipment when the remote working activities are terminated.

##### Control

> Security perimeters should be defined and used to protect areas that
> contain information and other associated assets.

##### Purpose

> To prevent unauthorized physical access, damage and interference to
> the organization's information and other associated assets.

##### Guidance

> The following guidelines should be considered and implemented where
> appropriate for physical security perimeters:

a)  defining security perimeters and the siting and strength of each of
    the perimeters in accordance with the information security
    requirements related to the assets within the perimeter;

b)  having physically sound perimeters for a building or site containing
    > information processing facilities (i.e. there should be no gaps in
    > the perimeter or areas where a break-in can easily occur). The
    > exterior roofs, walls, ceilings and flooring of the site should be
    > of solid construction and all external doors should be suitably
    > protected against unauthorized access with control mechanisms
    > (e.g. bars, alarms, locks). Doors and windows should be locked
    > when unattended and external protection should be considered for
    > windows, particularly at ground level; ventilation points should
    > also be considered;

c)  alarming, monitoring and testing all fire doors on a security
    > perimeter in conjunction with the walls to establish the required
    > level of resistance in accordance with suitable standards. They
    > should operate in a failsafe manner.

##### Other information

> Physical protection can be achieved by creating one or more physical
> barriers around the organization's premises and information processing
> facilities.
>
> A secure area can be a lockable office or several rooms surrounded by
> a continuous internal physical security barrier. Additional barriers
> and perimeters to control physical access can be necessary between
> areas with different security requirements inside the security
> perimeter. The organization should consider having physical security
> measures that can be strengthened during increased threat situations.

##### Control

> Secure areas should be protected by appropriate entry controls and
> access points.

##### Purpose

> To ensure only authorized physical access to the organization's
> information and other associated assets
>
> occurs. **Guidance** [General]{.underline}
>
> Access points such as delivery and loading areas and other points
> where unauthorized persons can enter the premises should be controlled
> and, if possible, isolated from information processing facilities to
> avoid unauthorized access.
>
> The following guidelines should be considered:

a)  restricting access to sites and buildings to authorized personnel
    only. The process for the management of access rights to physical
    areas should include the provision, periodical review, update and
    revocation of authorizations (see
    [[5.18]{.underline}](#access-rights));

b)  securely maintaining and monitoring a physical logbook or electronic
    audit trail of all access and protecting all logs (see
    [[5.33]{.underline}](#protection-of-records)) and sensitive
    authentication information;

c)  establishing and implementing a process and technical mechanisms for
    the management of access to areas where information is processed or
    stored. Authentication mechanisms include the use of access cards,
    biometrics or two-factor authentication such as an access card and
    secret PIN. Double security doors should be considered for access to
    sensitive areas;

d)  setting up a reception area monitored by personnel, or other means
    > to control physical access to the site or building;

e)  inspecting and examining personal belongings of personnel and
    > interested parties upon entry and exit;

> NOTE Local legislation and regulations can exist regarding the
> possibility of inspecting personal
>
> belongings.

f)  requiring all personnel and interested parties to wear some form of
    > visible identification and to immediately notify security
    > personnel if they encounter unescorted visitors and anyone not
    > wearing visible identification. Easily distinguishable badges
    > should be considered to better identify permanent employees,
    > suppliers and visitors;

g)  granting supplier personnel restricted access to secure areas or
    > information processing facilities only when required. This access
    > should be authorized and monitored;

h)  giving special attention to physical access security in the case of
    > buildings holding assets for multiple organizations;

i)  designing physical security measures so that they can be
    > strengthened when the likelihood of physical incidents increases;

j)  securing other entry points such as emergency exits from
    > unauthorized access;

k)  setting up a key management process to ensure the management of the
    > physical keys or authentication information (e.g. lock codes,
    > combination locks to offices, rooms and facilities such as key
    > cabinets) and to ensure a log book or annual key audit and that
    > access to physical keys or authentication information is
    > controlled (see [[5.17]{.underline}](#authentication-information)
    > for further guidance on authentication information).

> [Visitors]{.underline}
>
> The following guidelines should be considered:

a)  authenticating the identity of visitors by an appropriate means;

b)  recording the date and time of entry and departure of visitors;

c)  only granting access for visitors for specific, authorized purposes
    and with instructions on the security requirements of the area and
    on emergency procedures;

d)  supervising all visitors, unless an explicit exception is granted.
    > [Delivery and loading areas and incoming material]{.underline}

> The following guidelines should be considered:

a)  restricting access to delivery and loading areas from outside of the
    building to identified and authorized personnel;

b)  designing the delivery and loading areas so that deliveries can be
    loaded and unloaded without delivery personnel gaining unauthorized
    access to other parts of the building;

c)  securing the external doors of delivery and loading areas when doors
    to restricted areas are opened;

d)  inspecting and examining incoming deliveries for explosives,
    chemicals or other hazardous materials before they are moved from
    delivery and loading areas;

e)  registering incoming deliveries in accordance with asset management
    procedures (see
    [[5.9]{.underline}](#inventory-of-information-and-other-associated-assets)
    and [[7.10]{.underline}](#storage-media)) on entry to the site;

f)  physically segregating incoming and outgoing shipments, where
    > possible;

g)  inspecting incoming deliveries for evidence of tampering on the way.
    > If tampering is discovered, it should be immediately reported to
    > security personnel.

##### Guidance

> The following guidelines should be considered to secure offices, rooms
> and facilities:

a)  siting critical facilities to avoid access by the public;

b)  where applicable, ensuring buildings are unobtrusive and give
    minimum indication of their purpose, with no obvious signs, outside
    or inside the building, identifying the presence of information
    processing activities;

c)  configuring facilities to prevent confidential information or
    activities from being visible and audible from the outside.
    Electromagnetic shielding should also be considered as appropriate;

d)  not making directories, internal telephone books and online
    accessible maps identifying locations of confidential information
    processing facilities readily available to any unauthorized person.

##### Control

> Premises should be continuously monitored for unauthorized physical
> access.

##### Purpose

> To detect and deter unauthorized physical access.

##### Guidance

> Physical premises should be monitored by surveillance systems, which
> can include guards, intruder alarms, video monitoring systems such as
> closed-circuit television and physical security information management
> software either managed internally or by a monitoring service
> provider.
>
> Access to buildings that house critical systems should be continuously
> monitored to detect unauthorized access or suspicious behaviour by:

a)  installing video monitoring systems such as closed-circuit
    television to view and record access to sensitive areas within and
    outside an organization's premises;

b)  installing, according to relevant applicable standards, and
    periodically testing contact, sound or motion detectors to trigger
    an intruder alarm such as:

    1.  installing contact detectors that trigger an alarm when a
        contact is made or broken in any place where a contact can be
        made or broken (such as windows and doors and underneath
        objects) to be used as a panic alarm;

    2.  motion detectors based on infra-red technology which trigger an
        alarm when an object passes through their field of view;

    3.  installing sensors sensitive to the sound of breaking glass
        which can be used to trigger an alarm to alert security
        personnel;

c)  using those alarms to cover all external doors and accessible
    windows. Unoccupied areas should be alarmed at all times; cover
    should also be provided for other areas (e.g. computer or
    communications rooms).

> The design of monitoring systems should be kept confidential because
> disclosure can facilitate undetected break-ins.
>
> Monitoring systems should be protected from unauthorized access in
> order to prevent surveillance information, such as video feeds, from
> being accessed by unauthorized persons or systems being disabled
> remotely.
>
> The alarm system control panel should be placed in an alarmed zone
> and, for safety alarms, in a place that allows an easy exit route for
> the person who sets the alarm. The control panel and the detectors
> should have tamperproof mechanisms. The system should regularly be
> tested to ensure that it is working as intended, particularly if its
> components are battery powered.
>
> Any monitoring and recording mechanism should be used taking into
> consideration local laws and regulations including data protection and
> PII protection legislation, especially regarding the monitoring of
> personnel and recorded video retention periods.

##### Control

> Protection against physical and environmental threats, such as natural
> disasters and other intentional or unintentional physical threats to
> infrastructure should be designed and implemented.

##### Purpose

> To prevent or reduce the consequences of events originating from
> physical and environmental threats.

##### Guidance

> Risk assessments to identify the potential consequences of physical
> and environmental threats should be performed prior to beginning
> critical operations at a physical site, and at regular intervals.
> Necessary safeguards should be implemented and changes to threats
> should be monitored. Specialist advice should be obtained on how to
> manage risks arising from physical and environmental threats such as
> fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, civil unrest, toxic waste,
> environmental emissions and other forms of natural disaster or
> disaster caused by human beings.
>
> Physical premises location and construction should take account of:

a)  local topography, such as appropriate elevation, bodies of water and
    tectonic fault lines;

b)  urban threats, such as locations with a high profile for attracting
    political unrest, criminal activity or terrorist attacks.

> Based on risk assessment results, relevant physical and environmental
> threats should be identified and appropriate controls considered in
> the following contexts as examples:

a)  fire: installing and configuring systems able to detect fires at an
    early stage to send alarms or trigger fire suppression systems in
    order to prevent fire damage to storage media and to related
    information processing systems. Fire suppression should be performed
    using the most appropriate substance with regard to the surrounding
    environment (e.g. gas in confined spaces);

b)  flooding: installing systems able to detect flooding at an early
    stage under the floors of areas containing storage media or
    information processing systems. Water pumps or equivalent means
    should be readily made available in case flooding occurs;

c)  electrical surges: adopting systems able to protect both server and
    client information systems against electrical surges or similar
    events to minimize the consequences of such events;

d)  explosives and weapons: performing random inspections for the
    presence of explosives or weapons on personnel, vehicles or goods
    entering sensitive information processing facilities.

##### Other information

> Safes or other forms of secure storage facilities can protect
> information stored therein against disasters such as a fire,
> earthquake, flood or explosion.
>
> Organizations can consider the concepts of crime prevention through
> environmental design when designing the controls to secure their
> environment and reduce urban threats. For example, instead of using
> bollards, statues or water features can serve as both a feature and a
> physical barrier.

c)  leaving user endpoint devices logged off or protected with a screen
    > and keyboard locking mechanism controlled by a user authentication
    > mechanism when unattended. All computers and systems should be
    > configured with a timeout or automatic logout feature;

d)  making the originator collect outputs from printers or
    > multi-function devices immediately. The use of printers with an
    > authentication function, so the originators are the only ones who
    > can get their printouts and only when standing next to the
    > printer;

e)  securely storing documents and removable storage media containing
    > sensitive information and, when no longer required, discarding
    > them using secure disposal mechanisms;

f)  establishing and communicating rules and guidance for the
    > configuration of pop-ups on screens (e.g. turning off the new

##### Control

> Off-site assets should be protected.

##### Purpose

> To prevent loss, damage, theft or compromise of off-site devices and
> interruption to the organization's operations.

##### Guidance

> Any device used outside the organization's premises which stores or
> processes information (e.g. mobile device), including devices owned by
> the organization and devices owned privately and used on behalf of the
> organization \[bring your own device (BYOD)\] needs protection. The
> use of these devices should be authorized by management.
>
> The following guidelines should be considered for the protection of
> devices which store or process
>
> information outside the organization's premises:

a)  not leaving equipment and storage media taken off premises
    unattended in public and unsecured places;

b)  observing manufacturers' instructions for protecting equipment at
    all times (e.g. protection against exposure to strong
    electromagnetic fields, water, heat, humidity, dust);

c)  when off-premises equipment is transferred among different
    individuals or interested parties, maintaining a log that defines
    the chain of custody for the equipment including at least names and
    organizations of those who are responsible for the equipment.
    Information that does not need to be transferred with the asset
    should be securely deleted before the transfer;

d)  where necessary and practical, requiring authorization for equipment
    and media to be removed from the organization's premises and keeping
    a record of such removals in order to maintain an audit trail (see
    [[5.14]{.underline}](#information-transfer));

e)  protecting against viewing information on a device (e.g. mobile or
    laptop) on public transport, and the risks associated with shoulder
    surfing;

f)  implementing location tracking and ability for remote wiping of
    devices.

> Permanent installation of equipment outside the organization's
> premises \[such as antennas and automated teller machines (ATMs)\] can
> be subject to higher risk of damage, theft or eavesdropping. These
> risks can vary considerably between locations and should be taken into
> account in determining the most appropriate measures. The following
> guidelines should be considered when siting this equipment outside of
> the organization's premises:

a)  physical security monitoring (see
    [[7.4]{.underline}](#physical-security-monitoring));

b)  protecting against physical and environmental threats (see
    [[7.5]{.underline}](#protecting-against-physical-and-environmental-threats));

> organization's classification scheme and handling requirements.

##### Purpose

> To ensure only authorized disclosure, modification, removal or
> destruction of information on storage media.

##### Guidance

> [Removable storage media]{.underline}
>
> The following guidelines for the management of removable storage media
> should be considered:

a)  establishing a topic-specific policy on the management of removable
    storage media and communicating such topic- specific policy to
    anyone who uses or handles removable storage media;

b)  where necessary and practical, requiring authorization for storage
    media to be removed from the organization and keeping a record of
    such removals in order to maintain an audit trail;

c)  storing all storage media in a safe, secure environment according to
    their information classification and protecting them against
    environmental threats (such as heat, moisture, humidity, electronic
    field or ageing), in accordance with manufacturers' specifications;

d)  if information confidentiality or integrity are important
    considerations, using cryptographic techniques to protect
    information on removable storage media;

e)  to mitigate the risk of storage media degrading while stored
    information is still needed, transferring the information to fresh
    storage media before becoming unreadable;

f)  storing multiple copies of valuable information on separate storage
    media to further reduce the risk of coincidental information damage
    or loss;

g)  considering the registration of removable storage media to limit the
    > chance for information loss;

h)  only enabling removable storage media ports \[e.g. secure digital
    > (SD) card slots and universal serial bus (USB) ports\] if there is
    > an organizational reason for their use;

i)  where there is a need to use removable storage media, monitoring the
    > transfer of information to such storage media;

j)  information can be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse or
    > corruption during physical transport, for instance when sending
    > storage media via the postal service or via courier.

> In this control, media includes paper documents. When transferring
> physical storage media, apply security measures in
> [[5.14]{.underline}](#information-transfer).
>
> [Secure reuse or disposal]{.underline}
>
> Procedures for the secure reuse or disposal of storage media should be
> established to minimize the risk of confidential information leakage
> to unauthorized persons. The procedures for secure reuse or disposal
> of storage media containing confidential information should be
> proportional to the sensitivity of that information. The following
> items should be considered:

a)  if storage media containing confidential information need to be
    reused within the organization, securely deleting data or formatting
    the storage media before reuse (see
    [[8.10]{.underline}](#information-deletion));

b)  disposing of storage media containing confidential information
    securely when not needed anymore (e.g. by destroying, shredding or
    securely deleting the content);

c)  having procedures in place to identify the items that can require
    secure disposal;

d)  many organizations offer collection and disposal services for
    storage media. Care should be taken in selecting a suitable external
    party supplier with adequate controls and experience;

e)  logging the disposal of sensitive items in order to maintain an
    audit trail;

f)  when accumulating storage media for disposal, giving consideration
    to the aggregation effect, which can cause a large quantity of
    non-sensitive information to become sensitive.

> A risk assessment should be performed on damaged devices containing
> sensitive data to determine whether the items should be physically
> destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded (see
> [[7.14]{.underline}](#secure-disposal-or-re-use-of-equipment)).

##### Other information

> When confidential information on storage media is not encrypted,
> additional physical protection of the storage media should be
> considered.

> utilities.

##### Purpose

> To prevent loss, damage or compromise of information and other
> associated assets, or interruption to the organization's operations
> due to failure and disruption of supporting utilities.

##### Guidance

> Organizations depend on utilities (e.g. electricity,
> telecommunications, water supply, gas, sewage, ventilation and air
> conditioning) to support their information processing facilities.
> Therefore, the organization should:

a)  ensure equipment supporting the utilities is configured, operated
    and maintained in accordance with the relevant manufacturer's
    specifications;

b)  ensure utilities are appraised regularly for their capacity to meet
    business growth and interactions with other supporting utilities;

c)  ensure equipment supporting the utilities is inspected and tested
    regularly to ensure their proper functioning;

d)  if necessary, raise alarms to detect utilities malfunctions;

e)  if necessary, ensure utilities have multiple feeds with diverse
    physical routing;

f)  ensure equipment supporting the utilities is on a separate network
    from the information processing facilities if connected to a
    network;

g)  ensure equipment supporting the utilities is connected to the
    internet only when needed and only in a secure manner.

> Emergency lighting and communications should be provided. Emergency
> switches and valves to cut off power, water, gas or other utilities
> should be located near emergency exits or equipment rooms. Emergency
> contact details should be recorded and available to personnel in the
> event of an outage.

##### Other information

> Additional redundancy for network connectivity can be obtained by
> means of multiple routes from more than one utility provider.

##### Guidance

> The following guidelines for cabling security should be considered:

a)  power and telecommunications lines into information processing
    facilities being underground where possible, or subject to adequate
    alternative protection, such as floor cable protector and utility
    pole; if cables are underground, protecting them from accidental
    cuts (e.g. with armoured conduits or signals of presence);

b)  segregating power cables from communications cables to prevent
    interference;

c)  for sensitive or critical systems, further controls to consider
    > include:

    1.  installation of armoured conduit and locked rooms or boxes and
        alarms at inspection and termination points;

    2.  use of electromagnetic shielding to protect the cables;

    3.  periodical technical sweeps and physical inspections to detect
        unauthorized devices being attached to the cables;

    4.  controlled access to patch panels and cable rooms (e.g. with
        mechanical keys or PINs);

    5.  use of fibre-optic cables;

d)  labelling cables at each end with sufficient source and destination
    > details to enable the physical identification and inspection of
    > the cable.

> Specialist advice should be sought on how to manage risks arising from
> cabling incidents or malfunctions.

##### Other information

> To protect information against the risks introduced by using user
> endpoint devices.

##### Guidance

> [General]{.underline}
>
> The organization should establish a topic-specific policy on secure
> configuration and handling of user endpoint devices. The
> topic-specific policy should be communicated to all relevant personnel
> and consider the following:

a)  the type of information and the classification level that the user
    endpoint devices can handle, process, store or support;

b)  registration of user endpoint devices;

c)  requirements for physical protection;

d)  restriction of software installation (e.g. remotely controlled by
    > system administrators);

e)  requirements for user endpoint device software (including software
    versions) and for applying updates (e.g. active automatic updating);

f)  rules for connection to information services, public networks or any
    other network off premises (e.g. requiring the use of personal
    firewall);

g)  access controls;

h)  storage device encryption;

i)  protection against malware;

j)  remote disabling, deletion or lockout;

k)  backups;

l)  usage of web services and web applications;

m)  end user behaviour analytics (see
    > [[8.16]{.underline}](#monitoring-activities));

n)  the use of removable devices, including removable memory devices,
    > and the possibility of disabling physical ports (e.g. USB ports);

o)  the use of partitioning capabilities, if supported by the user
    > endpoint device, which can securely separate the organization\'s
    > information and other associated assets (e.g. software) from other
    > information and other associated assets on the device.

> Consideration should be given as to whether certain information is so
> sensitive that it can only be accessed via user endpoint devices, but
> not stored on such devices. In such cases, additional technical
> safeguards can be required on the device. For example, ensuring that
> downloading files for offline working is disabled and that local
> storage such as SD card is disabled.
>
> As far as possible, the recommendations on this control should be
> enforced through configuration management (see
> [[8.9]{.underline}](#configuration-management)) or automated tools.
>
> [User responsibility]{.underline}
>
> All users should be made aware of the security requirements and
> procedures for protecting user endpoint devices, as well as of their
> responsibilities for implementing such security measures. Users should
> be advised to:

a)  log-off active sessions and terminate services when no longer
    needed;

b)  protect user endpoint devices from unauthorized use with a physical
    control (e.g. key lock or special locks) and logical control (e.g.
    password access) when not in use; not leave devices carrying
    important, sensitive or critical business information unattended;

c)  use devices with special care in public places, open offices,
    meeting places and other unprotected areas (e.g. avoid reading
    confidential information if people can read from the back, use
    privacy screen filters);

d)  physically protect user endpoint devices against theft (e.g. in cars
    and other forms of transport, hotel rooms, conference centres and
    meeting places).

> A specific procedure taking into account legal, statutory, regulatory,
> contractual (including insurance) and other security requirements of
> the organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of
> user endpoint devices.
>
> [Use of personal devices]{.underline}
>
> Where the organization allows the use of personal devices (sometimes
> known as BYOD), in addition to the guidance given in this control, the
> following should be considered:

a)  separation of personal and business use of the devices, including
    using software to support such separation and protect business data
    on a private device;

b)  providing access to business information only after users have
    acknowledged their duties (physical protection, software updating,
    etc.), waiving ownership of business data, allowing remote wiping of
    data by the organization in case of theft or loss of the device or
    when no longer authorized to use the service. In such cases, PII
    protection legislation should be considered;

c)  topic-specific policies and procedures to prevent disputes
    concerning rights to intellectual property developed on privately
    owned equipment;

d)  access to privately owned equipment (to verify the security of the
    > machine or during an investigation), which can be prevented by
    > legislation;

e)  software licensing agreements that are such that organizations can
    > become liable for licensing for client software on user endpoint
    > devices owned privately by personnel or external party users.

> [Wireless connections]{.underline}
>
> The organization should establish procedures for:

a)  the configuration of wireless connections on devices (e.g. disabling
    vulnerable protocols);

b)  using wireless or wired connections with appropriate bandwidth in
    accordance with relevant topic-specific policies (e.g. because
    backups or software updates are needed).

##### Other information

> Controls to protect information on user endpoint devices depend on
> whether the user endpoint device is used only inside of the
> organization\'s secured premises and network connections, or whether
> it is exposed to increased physical and network related threats
> outside of the organization.
>
> The wireless connections for user endpoint devices are similar to
> other types of network connections but have important differences that
> should be considered when identifying controls. In particular, back-up
> of information stored on user endpoint devices can sometimes fail
> because of limited network bandwidth or because user endpoint devices
> are not connected at the times when backups are scheduled.
>
> For some USB ports, such as USB-C, disabling the USB port is not
> possible because it is used for other purposes (e.g. power delivery
> and display output).

##### Control

> The allocation and use of privileged access rights should be
> restricted and managed.

##### Purpose

> To ensure only authorized users, software components and services are
> provided with privileged access rights.

##### Guidance

> The allocation of privileged access rights should be controlled
> through an authorization process in accordance with the relevant
> topic-specific policy on access control (see
> [[5.15]{.underline}](#access-control)). The following should be
> considered:

a)  identifying users who need privileged access rights for each system
    or process (e.g. operating systems, database management systems and
    applications);

b)  allocating privileged access rights to users as needed and on an
    event-by-event basis in line with the topic-specific policy on
    access control (see [[5.15]{.underline}](#access-control)) (i.e.
    only to individuals with the necessary competence to carry out
    activities that require privileged access and based on the minimum
    requirement for their functional roles);

c)  maintaining an authorization process (i.e. determining who can
    > approve privileged access rights, or not granting privileged
    > access rights until the authorization process is complete) and a
    > record of all privileges allocated;

d)  defining and implementing requirements for expiry of privileged
    > access rights;

e)  taking measures to ensure that users are aware of their privileged
    > access rights and when they are in privileged access mode.
    > Possible measures include using specific user identities, user
    > interface settings or even specific equipment;

f)  authentication requirements for privileged access rights can be
    > higher than the requirements for normal access rights.
    > Re-authentication or authentication step-up can be necessary
    > before doing work with privileged access rights;

g)  regularly, and after any organizational change, reviewing users
    > working with privileged access rights in order to verify if their
    > duties, roles, responsibilities and competence still qualify them
    > for working with privileged access rights (see
    > [[5.18]{.underline}](#access-rights));

h)  establishing specific rules in order to avoid the use of generic
    > administration user IDs (such as "root"), depending on systems'
    > configuration capabilities. Managing and protecting authentication
    > information of such identities (see
    > [[5.17]{.underline}](#authentication-information));

i)  granting temporary privileged access just for the time window
    > necessary to implement approved changes or activities (e.g. for
    > maintenance activities or some critical changes), rather than
    > permanently granting privileged access rights. This is often
    > referred as break glass procedure, and often automated by
    > privilege access management technologies;

j)  logging all privileged access to systems for audit purposes;

k)  not sharing or linking identities with privileged access rights to
    > multiple persons, assigning each person a separate identity which
    > allows assigning specific privileged access rights. Identities can
    > be grouped (e.g. by defining an administrator group) in order to
    > simplify the management of privileged access rights;

l)  only using identities with privileged access rights for undertaking
    > administrative tasks and not for day-to-day general tasks \[i.e.
    > checking email, accessing the web (users should have a separate
    > normal network identity for these activities)\].

##### Other information

> Privileged access rights are access rights provided to an identity, a
> role or a process that allows the performance of activities that
> typical users or processes cannot perform. System administrator roles
> typically require privileged access rights.
>
> Inappropriate use of system administrator privileges (any feature or
> facility of an information system that enables the user to override
> system or application controls) is a major contributory factor to
> failures or breaches of systems.
>
> More information related to access management and the secure
> management of access to information and information and communications
> technologies resources can be found in ISO/IEC 29146.

##### Control

> Access to information and other associated assets should be restricted
> in accordance with the established topic-specific policy on access
> control.

##### Purpose

> To ensure only authorized access and to prevent unauthorized access to
> information and other associated assets.

##### Guidance

> Access to information and other associated assets should be restricted
> in accordance with the established topic-specific policies. The
> following should be considered in order to support access restriction
> requirements:

a)  not allowing access to sensitive information by unknown user
    identities or anonymously. Public or anonymous access should only be
    granted to storage locations that do not contain any sensitive
    information;

b)  providing configuration mechanisms to control access to information
    in systems, applications and services;

c)  controlling which data can be accessed by a particular user;

d)  controlling which identities or group of identities have which
    access, such as read, write, delete and execute;

e)  providing physical or logical access controls for the isolation of
    sensitive applications, application data, or systems.

> Further, dynamic access management techniques and processes to protect
> sensitive information that has high value to the organization should
> be considered when the organization:

a)  needs granular control over who can access such information during
    what period and in what way;

b)  wants to share such information with people outside the organization
    and maintain control over who can access it;

c)  wants to dynamically manage, in real-time, the use and distribution
    of such information;

d)  wants to protect such information against unauthorized changes,
    copying and distribution (including printing);

e)  wants to monitor the use of the information;

f)  wants to record any changes to such information that take place in
    case a future investigation is required.

> Dynamic access management techniques should protect information
> throughout its life cycle (i.e. creation, processing, storage,
> transmission and disposal), including:

a)  establishing rules on the management of dynamic access based on
    specific use cases considering:

    1.  granting access permissions based on identity, device, location
        or application;

    2.  leveraging the classification scheme in order to determine what
        information needs to be protected with dynamic access management
        techniques;

b)  establishing operational, monitoring and reporting processes and
    supporting technical infrastructure.

> Dynamic access management systems should protect information by:

a)  requiring authentication, appropriate credentials or a certificate
    to access information;

b)  restricting access, for example to a specified time frame (e.g.
    after a given date or until a particular date);

c)  using encryption to protect information;

d)  defining the printing permissions for the information;

e)  recording who accesses the information and how the information is
    used;

f)  raising alerts if attempts to misuse the information are detected.

##### Other information

> Dynamic access management techniques and other dynamic information
> protection technologies can support the protection of information even
> when data is shared beyond the originating organization, where
> traditional access controls cannot be enforced. It can be applied to
> documents, emails or other files containing information to limit who
> can access the content and in what way. It can be at a granular level
> and be adapted over the life cycle of the information.
>
> Dynamic access management techniques do not replace classical access
> management \[e.g. using access control lists (ACLs)\], but can add
> more factors for conditionality, real-time evaluation, just-in-time
> data reduction and other enhancements that can be useful for the most
> sensitive information. It offers a way to control access outside the
> organization's environment. Incident response can be supported by
> dynamic access management techniques as permissions can be modified or
> revoked at any time.

##### Control

> Read and write access to source code, development tools and software
> libraries should be appropriately managed.

##### Purpose

> To prevent the introduction of unauthorized functionality, avoid
> unintentional or malicious changes and to maintain the confidentiality
> of valuable intellectual property.

##### Guidance

> Access to source code and associated items (such as designs,
> specifications, verification plans and validation plans) and
> development tools (e.g. compilers, builders, integration tools, test
> platforms and environments) should be strictly controlled.
>
> For source code, this can be achieved by controlling central storage
> of such code, preferably in source code management system.
>
> Read access and write access to source code can differ based on the
> personnel's role. For example, read access to source code can be
> broadly provided inside the organization, but write access to source
> code
>
> is only made available to privileged personnel or designated owners.
> Where code components are used by several developers within an
> organization, read access to a centralized code repository should be
> implemented. Furthermore, if open-source code or third-party code
> components are used inside an organization, read access to such
> external code repositories can be broadly provided. However, write
> access should still be restricted.
>
> The following guidelines should be considered to control access to
> program source libraries in order to reduce the potential for
> corruption of computer programs:

a)  managing the access to program source code and the program source
    libraries according to established procedures;

b)  granting read and write access to source code based on business
    needs and managed to address risks of alteration or misuse and
    according to established procedures;

c)  updating of source code and associated items and granting of access
    to source code in accordance with change control procedures (see
    [[8.32]{.underline}](#change-management)) and only performing it
    after appropriate authorization has been received;

d)  not granting developers direct access to the source code repository,
    but through developer tools that control activities and
    authorizations on the source code;

e)  holding program listings in a secure environment, where read and
    write access should be appropriately managed and assigned;

f)  maintaining an audit log of all accesses and of all changes to
    source code.

> If the program source code is intended to be published, additional
> controls to provide assurance on its integrity (e.g. digital
> signature) should be considered.

##### Other information

> If access to source code is not properly controlled, source code can
> be modified or some data in the development environment (e.g. copies
> of production data, configuration details) can be retrieved by
> unauthorized persons.

##### Control

> Secure authentication technologies and procedures should be
> implemented based on information access restrictions and the
> topic-specific policy on access control.

##### Purpose

> To ensure a user or an entity is securely authenticated, when access
> to systems, applications and services is granted.

##### Guidance

> A suitable authentication technique should be chosen to substantiate
> the claimed identity of a user, software, messages and other entities.
>
> The strength of authentication should be appropriate for the
> classification of the information to be accessed. Where strong
> authentication and identity verification is required, authentication
> methods
>
> alternative to passwords, such as digital certificates, smart cards,
> tokens or biometric means, should be
>
> used.
>
> Authentication information should be accompanied by additional
> authentication factors for accessing critical information systems
> (also known as multi-factor authentication). Using a combination of
> multiple authentication factors, such as what you know, what you have
> and what you are, reduces the possibilities for unauthorized accesses.
> Multi-factor authentication can be combined with other techniques to
> require additional factors under specific circumstances, based on
> predefined rules and patterns, such as access from an unusual
> location, from an unusual device or at an unusual time.
>
> Biometric authentication information should be invalidated if it is
> ever compromised. Biometric authentication can be unavailable
> depending on the conditions of use (e.g. moisture or aging). To
> prepare for these issues, biometric authentication should be
> accompanied with at least one alternative authentication technique.
>
> The procedure for logging into a system or application should be
> designed to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. Log-on
> procedures and technologies should be implemented considering the
> following:

a)  not displaying sensitive system or application information until the
    log-on process has been successfully completed in order to avoid
    providing an unauthorized user with any unnecessary assistance;

b)  displaying a general notice warning that the system or the
    application or the service should only be accessed by authorized
    users;

c)  not providing help messages during the log-on procedure that would
    aid an unauthorized user (e.g. if an error condition arises, the
    system should not indicate which part of the data is correct or
    incorrect);

d)  validating the log-on information only on completion of all input
    > data;

e)  protecting against brute force log-on attempts on usernames and
    passwords \[e.g. using completely automated public Turing test to
    tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA), requiring password reset
    after a predefined number of failed attempts or blocking the user
    after a maximum number of errors\];

f)  logging unsuccessful and successful attempts;

g)  raising a security event if a potential attempted or successful
    breach of log-on controls is detected (e.g. sending an alert to the
    user and the organization's system administrators when a certain
    number of wrong password attempts has been reached);

h)  displaying or sending the following information on a separate
    channel on completion of a successful

> log-on:

1.  date and time of the previous successful log-on;

2.  details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last
    successful log-on;

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
i)  not displaying a password in clear text when it is being entered; in
    some cases, it can be required to de-activate this functionality in
    order to facilitate user log-on (e.g. for accessibility reasons or
    to avoid blocking users because of repeated errors);

j)  not transmitting passwords in clear text over a network to avoid
    being captured by a network \"sniffer" program;

k)  terminating inactive sessions after a defined period of inactivity,
    especially in high risk locations such as public or external areas
    outside the organization's security management or on user endpoint
    devices;

l)  restricting connection duration times to provide additional security
    > for high-risk applications and reduce the window of opportunity
    > for unauthorized access.

##### Control

> The use of resources should be monitored and adjusted in line with
> current and expected capacity requirements.

##### Purpose

> To ensure the required capacity of information processing facilities,
> human resources, offices and other facilities.

##### Guidance

> Capacity requirements for information processing facilities, human
> resources, offices and other facilities should be identified, taking
> into account the business criticality of the concerned systems and
> processes.
>
> System tuning and monitoring should be applied to ensure and, where
> necessary, improve the availability and efficiency of systems.
>
> The organization should perform stress-tests of systems and services
> to confirm that sufficient system capacity is available to meet peak
> performance requirements.
>
> Detective controls should be put in place to indicate problems in due
> time.
>
> Projections of future capacity requirements should take account of new
> business and system requirements and current and projected trends in
> the organization's information processing capabilities.
>
> Particular attention should be paid to any resources with long
> procurement lead times or high costs. Therefore, managers, service or
> product owners should monitor the utilization of key system resources.
>
> Managers should use capacity information to identify and avoid
> potential resource limitations and dependency on key personnel which
> can present a threat to system security or services and plan
> appropriate action.
>
> Providing sufficient capacity can be achieved by increasing capacity
> or by reducing demand. The following should be considered to increase
> capacity:

a)  hiring new personnel;

b)  obtaining new facilities or space;

c)  acquiring more powerful processing systems, memory and storage;

d)  making use of cloud computing, which has inherent characteristics
    that directly address issues of capacity. Cloud computing has
    elasticity and scalability which enable on-demand rapid expansion
    and reduction in resources available to particular applications and
    services.

> The following should be considered to reduce demand on the
> organization's resources:

a)  deletion of obsolete data (disk space);

b)  disposal of hardcopy records that have met their retention period
    (free up shelving space);

c)  decommissioning of applications, systems, databases or environments;

d)  optimizing batch processes and schedules;

e)  optimizing application code or database queries;

f)  denying or restricting bandwidth for resource-consuming services if
    these are not critical (e.g. video streaming).

> A documented capacity management plan should be considered for mission
> critical systems.

##### Control

> Protection against malware should be implemented and supported by
> appropriate user awareness.

##### Purpose

> To ensure information and other associated assets are protected
> against malware.

##### Guidance

> Protection against malware should be based on malware detection and
> repair software, information security awareness, appropriate system
> access and change management controls. Use of malware detection and
> repair software alone is not usually adequate. The following guidance
> should be considered:

a)  implementing rules and controls that prevent or detect the use of
    unauthorized software \[e.g. application allowlisting (i.e. using a
    list providing allowed applications)\] (see
    [[8.19]{.underline}](#installation-of-software-on-operational-systems)
    and [[8.32]{.underline}](#change-management));

b)  implementing controls that prevent or detect the use of known or
    suspected malicious websites (e.g. blocklisting);

c)  reducing vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malware \[e.g.
    through technical vulnerability management (see
    [[8.8]{.underline}](#management-of-technical-vulnerabilities) and
    [[8.19]{.underline}](#installation-of-software-on-operational-systems))\];

d)  conducting regular automated validation of the software and data
    content of systems, especially for systems supporting critical
    business processes; investigating the presence of any unapproved
    files or unauthorized amendments;

e)  establishing protective measures against risks associated with
    obtaining files and software either from or via external networks or
    on any other medium;

f)  installing and regularly updating malware detection and repair
    > software to scan computers and electronic storage media. Carrying
    > out regular scans that include:

    1.  scanning any data received over networks or via any form of
        electronic storage media, for malware before use;

    2.  scanning email and instant messaging attachments and downloads
        for malware before use. Carrying out this scan at different
        places (e.g. at email servers, desktop computers) and when
        entering the network of the organization;

    3.  scanning webpages for malware when accessed;

g)  determining the placement and configuration of malware detection and
    > repair tools based on risk assessment outcomes and considering:

    1.  defence in depth principles where they would be most effective.
        For example, this can lead to malware detection in a network
        gateway (in various application protocols such as email, file
        transfer and web) as well as user endpoint devices and servers;

    2.  the evasive techniques of attackers (e.g. the use of encrypted
        files) to deliver malware or the use of encryption protocols to
        transmit malware;

h)  taking care to protect against the introduction of malware during
    > maintenance and emergency procedures, which can bypass normal
    > controls against malware;

i)  implementing a process to authorize temporarily or permanently
    > disable some or all measures against malware, including exception
    > approval authorities, documented justification and review date.
    > This can be necessary when the protection against malware causes
    > disruption to normal operations;

j)  preparing appropriate business continuity plans for recovering from
    > malware attacks, including all necessary data and software backup
    > (including both online and offline backup) and recovery measures
    > (see [[8.13]{.underline}](#information-backup));

k)  isolating environments where catastrophic consequences can occur;

l)  defining procedures and responsibilities to deal with protection
    > against malware on systems, including training in their use,
    > reporting and recovering from malware attacks;

m)  providing awareness or training (see
    > [[6.3]{.underline}](#information-security-awareness-education-and-training))
    > to all users on how to identify and potentially mitigate the
    > receipt, sending or installation of malware infected emails, files
    > or programs \[the information collected in n) and o) can be used
    > to ensure awareness and training are kept up-to-date\];

n)  implementing procedures to regularly collect information about new
    > malware, such as subscribing to mailing lists or reviewing
    > relevant websites;

o)  verifying that information relating to malware, such as warning
    > bulletins, comes from qualified and reputable sources (e.g.
    > reliable internet sites or suppliers of malware detection
    > software) and is accurate and informative.

##### Other information

> It is not always possible to install software that protects against
> malware on some systems (e.g. some industrial control systems). Some
> forms of malware infect computer operating systems and computer
> firmware such that common malware controls cannot clean the system and
> a full reimaging of the operating system software and sometimes the
> computer firmware is necessary to return to a secure state.

##### Control

> Information about technical vulnerabilities of information systems in
> use should be obtained, the organization's exposure to such
> vulnerabilities should be evaluated and appropriate measures should be
> taken.

##### Purpose

> To prevent exploitation of technical vulnerabilities.

##### Guidance

> [Identifying technical vulnerabilities]{.underline}
>
> The organization should have an accurate inventory of assets (see
> [[5.9]{.underline}](#inventory-of-information-and-other-associated-assets)
> to [[5.14]{.underline}](#information-transfer)) as a prerequisite for
> effective technical vulnerability management; the inventory should
> include the software vendor, software name, version numbers, current
> state of deployment (e.g. what software is installed on what systems)
> and the person(s) within the organization responsible for the
> software.
>
> To identify technical vulnerabilities, the organization should
> consider:

a)  defining and establishing the roles and responsibilities associated
    with technical vulnerability management, including vulnerability
    monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment, updating, asset tracking
    and any coordination responsibilities required;

b)  for software and other technologies (based on the asset inventory
    list, see
    [[5.9]{.underline}](#inventory-of-information-and-other-associated-assets)),
    identifying information resources that will be used for identifying
    relevant technical vulnerabilities and maintaining awareness about
    them. Updating the list of information resources based on changes in
    the inventory or when other new or useful resources are found;

c)  requiring suppliers of information system (including their
    components) to ensure vulnerability reporting, handling and
    disclosure, including the requirements in applicable contracts (see
    [[5.20]{.underline}](#addressing-information-security-within-supplier-agreements));

d)  using vulnerability scanning tools suitable for the technologies in
    use to identify vulnerabilities and to verify whether the patching
    of vulnerabilities was successful;

e)  conducting planned, documented and repeatable penetration tests or
    vulnerability assessments by competent and authorized persons to
    support the identification of vulnerabilities. Exercising caution as
    such activities can lead to a compromise of the security of the
    system;

f)  tracking the usage of third-party libraries and source code for
    vulnerabilities. This should be

> included in secure coding (see [[8.28]{.underline}](#secure-coding)).
>
> The organization should develop procedures and capabilities to:

a)  detect the existence of vulnerabilities in its products and services
    including any external component used in these;

b)  receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources.

> The organization should provide a public point of contact as part of a
> topic-specific policy on vulnerability disclosure so that researchers
> and others are able to report issues. The organization should
> establish vulnerability reporting procedures, online reporting forms
> and making use of appropriate threat intelligence or information
> sharing forums. The organization should also consider bug bounty
> programs
>
> where rewards are offered as an incentive to assist organizations in
> identifying vulnerabilities in order to appropriately remediate them.
> The organization should also share information with competent industry
> bodies or other interested parties.
>
> [Evaluating technical vulnerabilities]{.underline}
>
> To evaluate identified technical vulnerabilities, the following
> guidance should be considered:

a.  analyse and verify reports to determine what response and
    remediation activity is needed;

b.  once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified,
    identifying the associated risks and the actions to be taken. Such
    actions can involve updating vulnerable systems or applying other
    controls.

> [Taking appropriate measures to address technical
> vulnerabilities]{.underline}
>
> A software update management process should be implemented to ensure
> the most up-to-date approved patches and application updates are
> installed for all authorized software. If changes are necessary, the
> original software should be retained and the changes applied to a
> designated copy. All changes should be fully tested and documented, so
> that they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades.
> If required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an
> independent evaluation body.
>
> The following guidance should be considered to address technical
> vulnerabilities:

a)  taking appropriate and timely action in response to the
    identification of potential technical vulnerabilities; defining a
    timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical
    vulnerabilities;

b)  depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be
    addressed, carrying out the action according to the controls related
    to change management (see [[8.32]{.underline}](#change-management))
    or by following information security incident response procedures
    (see
    [[5.26]{.underline}](#response-to-information-security-incidents));

c)  only using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or
    external to the organization);

d)  testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure
    they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be
    tolerated \[i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks
    associated with installing the update (the risks posed by the
    vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the
    update)\];

e)  addressing systems at high risk first;

f)  develop remediation (typically software updates or patches);

g)  test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective;

h)  provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation;

i)  if no update is available or the update cannot be installed,
    considering other controls, such as:

    1.  applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or
        other relevant sources;

    2.  turning off services or capabilities related to the
        vulnerability;

    3.  adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network
        borders (see [[8.20]{.underline}](#networks-security) to
        [[8.22]{.underline}](#segregation-of-networks));

    4.  shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from
        attack through deployment of suitable traffic filters (sometimes
        called virtual patching);

    5.  increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks;

    6.  raising awareness of the vulnerability.

> For acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information
> about security updates for their software and provide a facility to
> install such updates automatically, the organization should decide
> whether to use the automatic update or not.
>
> [Other considerations]{.underline}
>
> An audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical
> vulnerability management.
>
> The technical vulnerability management process should be regularly
> monitored and evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and
> efficiency.
>
> An effective technical vulnerability management process should be
> aligned with incident management activities, to communicate data on
> vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide
> technical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs.
>
> Where the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party
> cloud service provider, technical vulnerability management of cloud
> service provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service
> provider. The cloud service provider's responsibilities for technical
> vulnerability management should be part of the cloud service agreement
> and this should include processes for reporting the cloud service
> provider\'s actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see
> [[5.23]{.underline}](#information-security-for-use-of-cloud-services)).
> For some cloud services, there are respective responsibilities for the
> cloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example,
> the cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management
> of its own assets used for the cloud services.

##### Other information

> Technical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of
> change management and as such can take advantage of the change
> management processes and procedures (see
> [[8.32]{.underline}](#change-management)).
>
> There is a possibility that an update does not address the problem
> adequately and has negative side effects. Also, in some cases,
> uninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has
> been applied.
>
> If adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of
> costs or lack of resources) a delay in updating can be considered to
> evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by
> other users. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial.
>
> Where software patches or updates are produced, the organization can
> consider providing an automated update process where these updates are
> installed on affected systems or products without the need for
> intervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update
> process is offered, it can allow the customer or user to choose an
> option to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of the
> installation of the update.
>
> Where the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates
> can be installed on affected systems or products without the need for
> intervention, the organization determines if it applies the automated
> process or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to
> retain control over when the update is performed. For example, a
> software used for a business operation cannot be updated until the
> operation has completed.
>
> A weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does
> not fully account for defence in depth: two countermeasures that are
> always invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked by
> strengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not
> vulnerable, whereas a vulnerability scanner can report that both
> components are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care
> in reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports.
>
> Many organizations supply software, systems, products and services not
> only within the organization but also to interested parties such as
> customers, partners or other users. These software, systems, products
> and services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect
> the security of users.
>
> Organizations can release remediation and disclose information about
> vulnerabilities to users (typically through a public advisory) and
> provide appropriate information for software vulnerability database
> services.
>
> For more information relating to the management of technical
> vulnerabilities when using cloud computing, see the ISO/IEC 19086
> series and ISO/IEC 27017.

##### Control

> Configurations, including security configurations, of hardware,
> software, services and networks should be established, documented,
> implemented, monitored and reviewed.

##### Purpose

> To ensure hardware, software, services and networks function correctly
> with required security settings, and configuration is not altered by
> unauthorized or incorrect changes.

##### Guidance

> [General]{.underline}
>
> The organization should define and implement processes and tools to
> enforce the defined configurations (including security configurations)
> for hardware, software, services (e.g. cloud services) and networks,
> for newly installed systems as well as for operational systems over
> their lifetime.
>
> Roles, responsibilities and procedures should be in place to ensure
> satisfactory control of all configuration changes.
>
> [Standard templates]{.underline}
>
> Standard templates for the secure configuration of hardware, software,
> services and networks should be defined:

a)  using publicly available guidance (e.g. pre-defined templates from
    vendors and from independent security organizations);

b)  considering the level of protection needed in order to determine a
    sufficient level of security;

c)  supporting the organization's information security policy,
    topic-specific policies, standards and other security requirements;

d)  considering the feasibility and applicability of security
    > configurations in the organization's context.

> The templates should be reviewed periodically and updated when new
> threats or vulnerabilities need to be addressed, or when new software
> or hardware versions are introduced.
>
> The following should be considered for establishing standard templates
> for the secure configuration of hardware, software, services and
> networks:

a)  minimizing the number of identities with privileged or administrator
    level access rights;

b)  disabling unnecessary, unused or insecure identities;

c)  disabling or restricting unnecessary functions and services;

d)  restricting access to powerful utility programs and host parameter
    > settings;

e)  synchronizing clocks;

f)  changing vendor default authentication information such as default
    > passwords immediately after installation and reviewing other
    > important default security-related parameters;

g)  invoking time-out facilities that automatically log off computing
    > devices after a predetermined period of inactivity;

h)  verifying that licence requirements have been met (see
    > [[5.32]{.underline}](#intellectual-property-rights)).

> [Managing configurations]{.underline}
>
> Established configurations of hardware, software, services and
> networks should be recorded and a log should be maintained of all
> configuration changes. These records should be securely stored. This
> can be achieved in various ways, such as configuration databases or
> configuration templates.
>
> Changes to configurations should follow the change management process
> (see [[8.32]{.underline}](#change-management)). Configuration records
> can contain as relevant:

a)  up-to-date owner or point of contact information for the asset;

b)  date of the last change of configuration;

c)  version of configuration template;

d)  relation to configurations of other assets. [Monitoring
    > configurations]{.underline}

> Configurations should be monitored with a comprehensive set of system
> management tools (e.g. maintenance utilities, remote support,
> enterprise management tools, backup and restore software) and should
> be reviewed on a regular basis to verify configuration settings,
> evaluate password strengths and assess activities performed. Actual
> configurations can be compared with the defined target templates. Any
> deviations should be addressed, either by automatic enforcement of the
> defined target configuration or by manual analysis of the deviation
> followed by corrective actions.

##### Other information

> Documentation for systems often records details about the
> configuration of both hardware and software.
>
> System hardening is a typical part of configuration management.
>
> Configuration management can be integrated with asset management
> processes and associated tooling. Automation is usually more effective
> to manage security configuration (e.g. using infrastructure as
>
> code).
>
> Configuration templates and targets can be confidential information
> and should be protected from unauthorized access accordingly.

>
> Sensitive information should not be kept for longer than it is

> disclosure.
>
> When deleting information on systems, applications and services, the
> following should be considered:

a)  selecting a deletion method (e.g. electronic overwriting or
    cryptographic erasure) in accordance with business requirements and
    taking into consideration relevant laws and regulations;

b)  recording the results of deletion as evidence;

c)  when using service suppliers of information deletion, obtaining
    evidence of information deletion

> from them.
>
> Where third parties store the organization's information on its
> behalf, the organization should consider the inclusion of requirements
> on information deletion into the third-party agreements to enforce it
> during and upon termination of such services.
>
> [Deletion methods]{.underline}
>
> In accordance with the organization's topic-specific policy on data
> retention and taking into consideration relevant legislation and
> regulations, sensitive information should be deleted when no longer
> required, by:

a)  configuring systems to securely destroy information when no longer
    required (e.g. after a defined period subject to the topic-specific
    policy on data retention or by subject access request);

b)  deleting obsolete versions, copies and temporary files wherever they
    are located;

c)  using approved, secure deletion software to permanently delete
    information to help ensure information cannot be recovered by using
    specialist recovery or forensic tools;

d)  using approved, certified providers of secure disposal services;

e)  using disposal mechanisms appropriate for the type of storage media
    being disposed of (e.g. degaussing hard disk drives and other
    magnetic storage media).

> Where cloud services are used, the organization should verify if the
> deletion method provided by the cloud service provider is acceptable,
> and if it is the case, the organization should use it, or request that
> the cloud service provider delete the information. These deletion
> processes should be automated in
>
> accordance with topic-specific policies, when available and
> applicable. Depending on the sensitivity of information deleted, logs
> can track or verify that these deletion processes have happened.
>
> To avoid the unintentional exposure of sensitive information when
> equipment is being sent back to vendors, sensitive information should
> be protected by removing auxiliary storages (e.g. hard disk drives)
> and memory before equipment leaves the organization's premises.
>
> Considering that the secure deletion of some devices (e.g.
> smartphones) can only be achieved through destruction or using the
> functions embedded in these devices (e.g. "restore factory settings"),
> the organization should choose the appropriate method according to the
> classification of information handled by such devices.
>
> Control measures described in
> [[7.14]{.underline}](#secure-disposal-or-re-use-of-equipment) should
> be applied to physically destroy the storage device and simultaneously
> delete the information it contains.
>
> An official record of information deletion is useful when analysing
> the cause of a possible information leakage event.

##### Control

> Data masking should be used in accordance with the organization's
> topic-specific policy on access control and other related
> topic-specific policies, and business requirements, taking applicable
> legislation into consideration.

##### Purpose

> To limit the exposure of sensitive data including PII, and to comply
> with legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.

##### Guidance

> Where the protection of sensitive data (e.g. PII) is a concern, the
> organization should consider hiding such data by using techniques such
> as data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization.
>
> Pseudonymization or anonymization techniques can hide PII, disguise
> the true identity of PII principals or other sensitive information,
> and disconnect the link between PII and the identity of the PII
> principal or the link between other sensitive information.
>
> When using pseudonymization or anonymization techniques, it should be
> verified that data has been adequately pseudonymized or anonymized.
> Data anonymization should consider all the elements of the sensitive
> information to be effective. As an example, if not considered
> properly, a person can be identified even if the data that can
> directly identify that person is anonymised, by the presence of
> further data which allows the person to be identified indirectly.
>
> Additional techniques for data masking include:

a)  encryption (requiring authorized users to have a key);

b)  nulling or deleting characters (preventing unauthorized users from
    seeing full messages);

c)  varying numbers and dates;

d)  substitution (changing one value for another to hide sensitive
    > data);

e)  replacing values with their hash.

> The following should be considered when implementing data masking
> techniques:

a)  not granting all users access to all data, therefore designing
    queries and masks in order to show only the minimum required data to
    the user;

b)  there are cases where some data should not be visible to the user
    for some records out of a set of data; in this case, designing and
    implementing a mechanism for obfuscation of data (e.g. if a patient
    does not want hospital staff to be able to see all of their records,
    even in case of emergency, then the hospital staff are presented
    with partially obfuscated data and data can only be accessed by
    staff with specific roles if it contains useful information for
    appropriate treatment);

c)  when data are obfuscated, giving the PII principal the possibility
    to require that users cannot see if the data are obfuscated
    (obfuscation of the obfuscation; this is used in health facilities,
    for example if the patient does not want personnel to see that
    sensitive information such as pregnancies or results of blood exams
    has been obfuscated);

d)  any legal or regulatory requirements (e.g. requiring the masking of
    payment cards\' information during processing or storage).

> The following should be considered when using data masking,
> pseudonymization or anonymization:

a)  level of strength of data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization
    according to the usage of the processed data;

b)  access controls to the processed data;

c)  agreements or restrictions on usage of the processed data;

d)  prohibiting collating the processed data with other information in
    > order to identify the PII principal;

e)  keeping track of providing and receiving the processed data.

##### Other information

> Anonymization irreversibly alters PII in such a way that the PII
> principal can no longer be identified directly or indirectly.
>
> Pseudonymization replaces the identifying information with an alias.
> Knowledge of the algorithm (sometimes referred to as the "additional
> information") used to perform the pseudonymization allows for at least
> some form of identification of the PII principal. Such "additional
> information" should therefore be kept separate and protected.
>
> While pseudonymization is therefore weaker than anonymization,
> pseudonymized datasets can be more useful in statistical research.
>
> Data masking is a set of techniques to conceal, substitute or
> obfuscate sensitive data items. Data masking can be static (when data
> items are masked in the original database), dynamic (using automation
> and rules to secure data in real-time) or on-the-fly (with data masked
> in an application's memory).
>
> Hash functions can be used in order to anonymize PII. In order to
> prevent enumeration attacks, they should always be combined with a
> salt function.
>
> PII in resource identifiers and their attributes \[e.g. file names,
> uniform resource locators (URLs)\] should be either avoided or
> appropriately anonymized.
>
> Additional controls concerning the protection of PII in public clouds
> are given in ISO/IEC 27018.
>
> Additional information on de-identification techniques is available in
> ISO/IEC 20889.

##### Control

> Data leakage prevention measures should be applied to systems,
> networks and any other devices that process, store or transmit
> sensitive information.

##### Purpose

> To detect and prevent the unauthorized disclosure and extraction of
> information by individuals or systems.

##### Guidance

> The organization should consider the following to reduce the risk of
> data leakage:

a)  identifying and classifying information to protect against leakage
    (e.g. personal information, pricing models and product designs);

b)  monitoring channels of data leakage (e.g. email, file transfers,
    mobile devices and portable storage devices);

c)  acting to prevent information from leaking (e.g. quarantine emails
    containing sensitive information).

> Data leakage prevention tools should be used to:

a)  identify and monitor sensitive information at risk of unauthorized
    disclosure (e.g. in unstructured data on a user's system);

b)  detect the disclosure of sensitive information (e.g. when
    information is uploaded to untrusted third-party cloud services or
    sent via email);

c)  block user actions or network transmissions that expose sensitive
    information (e.g. preventing the copying of database entries into a
    spreadsheet).

> The organization should determine if it is necessary to restrict a
> user's ability to copy and paste or upload data to services, devices
> and storage media outside of the organization. If that is the case,
> the organization should implement technology such as data leakage
> prevention tools or the configuration of existing tools that allow
> users to view and manipulate data held remotely but prevent copy and
> paste outside of the organization's control.
>
> If data export is required, the data owner should be allowed to
> approve the export and hold users accountable for their actions.
>
> Taking screenshots or photographs of the screen should be addressed
> through terms and conditions of use, training and auditing.
>
> Where data is backed up, care should be taken to ensure sensitive
> information is protected using measures such as encryption, access
> control and physical protection of the storage media holding the
> backup.
>
> Data leakage prevention should also be considered to protect against
> the intelligence actions of an adversary from obtaining confidential
> or secret information (geopolitical, human, financial, commercial,
> scientific or any other) which can be of interest for espionage or can
> be critical for the community. The
>
> data leakage prevention actions should be oriented to confuse the
> adversary's decisions for example by replacing authentic information
> with false information, either as an independent action or as response
> to the adversary's intelligence actions. Examples of these kinds of
> actions are reverse social engineering or the use of honeypots to
> attract attackers.

##### Other information

> Data leakage prevention tools are designed to identify data, monitor
> data usage and movement, and take actions to prevent data from leaking
> (e.g. alerting users to their risky behaviour and blocking the
> transfer of data to portable storage devices).
>
> Data leakage prevention inherently involves monitoring personnel's
> communications and online activities, and by extension external party
> messages, which raises legal concerns that should be considered prior
> to deploying data leakage prevention tools. There is a variety of
> legislation relating to privacy, data protection, employment,
> interception of data and telecommunications that is applicable to
> monitoring and data processing in the context of data leakage
> prevention.
>
> Data leakage prevention can be supported by standard security

>
> Adequate backup facilities should be provided to ensure that all

>
> When designing a backup plan, the following items should be taken into

a)  producing accurate and complete records of the backup copies and
    documented restoration procedures;

b)  reflecting the business requirements of the organization (e.g. the
    recovery point objective, see
    [[5.30]{.underline}](#ict-readiness-for-business-continuity)), the
    security requirements of the information involved and the
    criticality of the information to the continued operation of the
    organization in the extent (e.g. full or differential backup) and
    frequency of backups;

c)  storing the backups in a safe and secure remote location, at a
    sufficient distance to escape any damage from a disaster at the main
    site;

d)  giving backup information an appropriate level of physical and
    environmental protection (see [[Clause
    7]{.underline}](#physical-controls) and
    [[8.1]{.underline}](#user-endpoint-devices)) consistent with the
    standards applied at the main site;

e)  regularly testing backup media to ensure that they can be relied on
    > for emergency use when necessary. Testing the ability to restore
    > backed-up data onto a test system, not by overwriting the original
    > storage media in case the backup or restoration process fails and
    > causes irreparable data damage or loss;

f)  protecting backups by means of encryption according to the
    > identified risks (e.g. in situations where confidentiality is of
    > importance);

g)  taking care to ensure that inadvertent data loss is detected before
    > backup is taken.

> Operational procedures should monitor the execution of backups and
> address failures of scheduled backups to ensure completeness of
> backups according to the topic-specific policy on backups.
>
> Backup measures for individual systems and services should be
> regularly tested to ensure that they meet the objectives of incident
> response and business continuity plans (see
> [[5.30]{.underline}](#ict-readiness-for-business-continuity)). This
> should be combined with a test of the restoration procedures and
> checked against the restoration time required by the business
> continuity plan. In the case of critical systems and services, backup
> measures should cover all systems information, applications and data
> necessary to recover the complete system in the event of a disaster.
>
> When the organization uses a cloud service, backup copies of the
> organization's information, applications and systems in the cloud
> service environment should be taken. The organization should determine
> if and how requirements for backup are fulfilled when using the
> information backup service provided as part of the cloud service.
>
> The retention period for essential business information should be

##### Purpose

> To ensure the continuous operation of information processing

##### Guidance

> The organization should identify requirements for the availability of
> business services and information systems. The organization should
> design and implement systems architecture with appropriate redundancy
> to meet these requirements.
>
> Redundancy can be introduced by duplicating information processing
> facilities in part or in their entirety (i.e. spare components or
> having two of everything). The organization should plan and implement
> procedures for the activation of the redundant components and
> processing facilities. The procedures should establish if the
> redundant components and processing activities are always
>
> activated, or in case of emergency, automatically or manually
> activated. The redundant components and information processing
> facilities should ensure the same security level as the primary ones.
>
> Mechanisms should be in place to alert the organization to any failure
> in the information processing facilities, enable executing the planned
> procedure and allow continued availability while the information
> processing facilities are repaired or replaced.
>
> The organization should consider the following when implementing
> redundant systems:

a)  contracting with two or more suppliers of network and critical
    information processing facilities such as internet service
    providers;

b)  using redundant networks;

c)  using two geographically separate data centres with mirrored
    systems;

d)  using physically redundant power supplies or sources;

e)  using multiple parallel instances of software components, with
    automatic load balancing between them (between instances in the same
    data centre or in different data centres);

f)  having duplicated components in systems (e.g. CPU, hard disks,
    memories) or in networks (e.g. firewalls, routers, switches).

> Where applicable, preferably in production mode, redundant information
> systems should be tested to ensure the failover from one component to
> another component works as intended.

##### Other information

> There is a strong relationship between redundancy and ICT readiness
> for business continuity (see
> [[5.30]{.underline}](#ict-readiness-for-business-continuity))
> especially if short recovery times are required. Many of the

> information systems.
>
> Redundancy in information processing facilities does not usually

c)  failure to record events or over-writing of past recorded events if
    > the storage media holding a log file is exceeded.

> For protection of logs, the use of the following techniques should be
> considered: cryptographic hashing, recording in an append-only and
> read-only file, recording in a public transparency file.
>
> Some audit logs can be required to be archived because of requirements
> on data retention or requirements to collect and retain evidence (see
> [[5.28]{.underline}](#collection-of-evidence)).
>
> Where the organization needs to send system or application logs to a
> vendor to assist with debugging or troubleshooting errors, logs should
> be de-identified where possible using data masking techniques (see
> [[8.11]{.underline}](#data-masking)) for information such as
> usernames, internet protocol (IP) addresses, hostnames or organization
> name, before sending to the vendor.
>
> Event logs can contain sensitive data and personally identifiable

>
> [Log analysis]{.underline}
>
> Log analysis should cover the analysis and interpretation of
> information security events, to help identify unusual activity or
> anomalous behaviour, which can represent indicators of compromise.
>
> Analysis of events should be performed by taking into account:

a)  the necessary skills for the experts performing the analysis;

b)  determining the procedure of log analysis;

c)  the required attributes of each security-related event;

d)  exceptions identified through the use of predetermined rules \[e.g.
    security information and event management (SIEM) or firewall rules,
    and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) or malware signatures\];

e)  known behaviour patterns and standard network traffic compared to
    anomalous activity and behaviour \[user and entity behaviour
    analytics (UEBA)\];

f)  results of trend or pattern analysis (e.g. as a result of using data
    analytics, big data techniques and specialized analysis tools);

g)  available threat intelligence.

> Log analysis should be supported by specific monitoring activities to
> help identify and analyse anomalous behaviour, which includes:

a)  reviewing successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected
    resources \[e.g. domain name system (DNS) servers, web portals and
    file shares\];

b)  checking DNS logs to identify outbound network connections to
    malicious servers, such as those associated with botnet command and
    control servers;

c)  examining usage reports from service providers (e.g. invoices or
    service reports) for unusual activity within systems and networks
    (e.g. by reviewing patterns of activity);

d)  including event logs of physical monitoring such as entrance and
    exit to ensure more accurate detection and incident analysis;

e)  correlating logs to enable efficient and highly accurate analysis.

> Suspected and actual information security incidents should be
> identified (e.g. malware infection or probing of firewalls) and be
> subject to further investigation (e.g. as part of an information
> security incident management process, see
> [[5.25]{.underline}](#assessment-and-decision-on-information-security-events)).

##### Other information

> System logs often contain a large volume of information, much of which
> is extraneous to information security monitoring. To help identify
> significant events for information security monitoring purposes, the
> use of suitable utility programs or audit tools to perform file
> interrogation can be considered.
>
> Event logging sets the foundation for automated monitoring systems
> (see [[8.16]{.underline}](#monitoring-activities)) which are capable
> of generating consolidated reports and alerts on system security.
>
> A SIEM tool or equivalent service can be used to store, correlate,
> normalize and analyse log information**,** and to generate alerts.
> SIEMs tend to require careful configuration to optimize their
> benefits. Configurations to consider include identification and
> selection of appropriate log sources, tuning and testing of rules and
> development of use cases.
>
> Public transparency files for the recording of logs are used, for
> example, in certificate transparency systems. Such files can provide
> an additional detection mechanism useful for guarding against log
> tampering.
>
> In cloud environments, log management responsibilities can be shared
> between the cloud service customer and the cloud service provider.
> Responsibilities vary depending on the type of cloud service being
> used. Further guidance can be found in ISO/IEC 27017.

##### Control

> Networks, systems and applications should be monitored for anomalous
> behaviour and appropriate actions taken to evaluate potential
> information security incidents.

##### Purpose

> To detect anomalous behaviour and potential information security
> incidents.

##### Guidance

> The monitoring scope and level should be determined in accordance with
> business and information security requirements and taking into
> consideration relevant laws and regulations. Monitoring records should
> be maintained for defined retention periods.
>
> The following should be considered for inclusion within the monitoring
> system:

a)  outbound and inbound network, system and application traffic;

b)  access to systems, servers, networking equipment, monitoring system,
    critical applications, etc.;

c)  critical or admin level system and network configuration files;

d)  logs from security tools \[e.g. antivirus, IDS, intrusion prevention
    system (IPS), web filters, firewalls, data leakage prevention\];

e)  event logs relating to system and network activity;

f)  checking that the code being executed is authorized to run in the
    > system and that it has not been tampered with (e.g. by
    > recompilation to add additional unwanted code);

g)  use of the resources (e.g. CPU, hard disks, memory, bandwidth) and
    > their performance.

> The organization should establish a baseline of normal behaviour and
> monitor against this baseline for anomalies. When establishing a
> baseline, the following should be considered:

a)  reviewing utilization of systems at normal and peak periods;

b)  usual time of access, location of access, frequency of access for
    each user or group of users.

> The monitoring system should be configured against the established
> baseline to identify anomalous behaviour, such as:

a)  unplanned termination of processes or applications;

b)  activity typically associated with malware or traffic originating
    from known malicious IP addresses or network domains (e.g. those
    associated with botnet command and control servers);

c)  known attack characteristics (e.g. denial of service and buffer
    overflows);

d)  unusual system behaviour (e.g. keystroke logging, process injection
    and deviations in use of standard protocols);

e)  bottlenecks and overloads (e.g. network queuing, latency levels and
    network jitter);

f)  unauthorized access (actual or attempted) to systems or information;

g)  unauthorized scanning of business applications, systems and
    networks;

h)  successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources
    (e.g. DNS servers, web portals and file systems);

i)  unusual user and system behaviour in relation to expected behaviour.

> Continuous monitoring via a monitoring tool should be used. Monitoring
> should be done in real time or in periodic intervals, subject to
> organizational need and capabilities. Monitoring tools should include
> the ability to handle large amounts of data, adapt to a constantly
> changing threat landscape, and allow for real-time notification. The
> tools should also be able to recognize specific signatures and data or
> network or application behaviour patterns.
>
> Automated monitoring software should be configured to generate alerts
> (e.g. via management consoles, email messages or instant messaging
> systems) based on predefined thresholds. The alerting system should be
> tuned and trained on the organization's baseline to minimize false
> positives. Personnel should be dedicated to respond to alerts and
> should be properly trained to accurately interpret potential
> incidents. There should be redundant systems and processes in place to
> receive and respond to alert notifications.
>
> Abnormal events should be communicated to relevant parties in order to
> improve the following activities: auditing, security evaluation,
> vulnerability scanning and monitoring (see
> [[5.25]{.underline}](#assessment-and-decision-on-information-security-events)).
> Procedures should be in place to respond to positive indicators from
> the monitoring system in a timely manner, in order to minimize the
> effect of adverse events (see
> [[5.26]{.underline}](#response-to-information-security-incidents)) on
> information security. Procedures should also be established to
> identify and address false positives including tuning the monitoring
> software to reduce the number of future false positives.

##### Other information

> Security monitoring can be enhanced by:

a)  leveraging threat intelligence systems (see
    [[5.7]{.underline}](#threat-intelligence));

b)  leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence
    > capabilities;

c)  using blocklists or allowlists;

d)  undertaking a range of technical security assessments (e.g.
    > vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, cyber-attack
    > simulations and cyber response exercises), and using the results
    > of these assessments to help determine baselines or acceptable
    > behaviour;

e)  using performance monitoring systems to help establish and detect
    > anomalous behaviour;

f)  leveraging logs in combination with monitoring systems.

> Monitoring activities are often conducted using specialist software,
> such as intrusion detection systems. These can be configured to a
> baseline of normal, acceptable and expected system and network
> activities.
>
> Monitoring for anomalous communications helps in the identification of
> botnets (i.e. set of devices under the malicious control of the botnet
> owner, usually used for mounting distributed denial of service attacks
> on other computers of other organizations). If the computer is being
> controlled by an external device, there is a communication between the
> infected device and the controller. The organization should therefore
> employ technologies to monitor for anomalous communications and take
> such action as necessary.

##### Control

> The clocks of information processing systems used by the organization
> should be synchronized to approved time sources.

##### Purpose

> To enable the correlation and analysis of security-related events and

> security incidents.

##### Guidance

> External and internal requirements for time representation, reliable
> synchronization and accuracy should be documented and implemented.
> Such requirements can be from legal, statutory, regulatory,
> contractual, standards and internal monitoring needs. A standard
> reference time for use within the organization should be defined and
> considered for all systems, including building management systems,
> entry and exit systems and others that can be used to aid
> investigations.
>
> A clock linked to a radio time broadcast from a national atomic clock
> or global positioning system (GPS) should be used as the reference
> clock for logging systems; a consistent, trusted date and time source
> to ensure accurate time-stamps. Protocols such as network time
> protocol (NTP) or precision time protocol (PTP) should be used to keep
> all networked systems in synchronization with a reference clock.
>
> The organization can use two external time sources at the same time in
> order to improve the reliability of external clocks, and appropriately
> manage any variance.
>
> Clock synchronization can be difficult when using multiple cloud
> services or when using both cloud and on-premises services. In this
> case, the clock of each service should be monitored and the difference
> recorded in order to mitigate risks arising from discrepancies.

##### Other information

> The correct setting of computer clocks is important to ensure the

d)  authorization for ad hoc use of utility programs;

e)  not making utility programs available to users who have access to
    > applications on systems where segregation of duties is required;

f)  removing or disabling all unnecessary utility programs;

g)  at a minimum, logical segregation of utility programs from
    > application software. Where practical, segregating network
    > communications for such programs from application traffic;

h)  limitation of the availability of utility programs (e.g. for the
    > duration of an authorized change);

i)  logging of all use of utility programs.

##### Other information

##### Control

> Procedures and measures should be implemented to securely manage
> software installation on operational systems.

##### Purpose

> To ensure the integrity of operational systems and prevent
> exploitation of technical vulnerabilities.

##### Guidance

> The following guidelines should be considered to securely manage
> changes and installation of software on operational systems:

a)  performing updates of operational software only by trained
    administrators upon appropriate management authorization (see
    [[8.5]{.underline}](#secure-authentication));

b)  ensuring that only approved executable code and no development code
    or compilers is installed on operational systems;

c)  only installing and updating software after extensive and successful
    testing (see
    [[8.29]{.underline}](#security-testing-in-development-and-acceptance)
    and
    [[8.31]{.underline}](#separation-of-development-test-and-production-environments));

d)  updating all corresponding program source libraries;

e)  using a configuration control system to keep control of all
    operational software as well as the system documentation;

f)  defining a rollback strategy before changes are implemented;

g)  maintaining an audit log of all updates to operational software;

h)  archiving old versions of software, together with all required
    information and parameters, procedures, configuration details and
    supporting software as a contingency measure, and for as long as the
    software is required to read or process archived data.

> Any decision to upgrade to a new release should take into account the
> business requirements for the change and the security of the release
> (e.g. the introduction of new information security functionality or
> the number and severity of information security vulnerabilities
> affecting the current version). Software patches should be applied
> when they can help to remove or reduce information security
> vulnerabilities (see
> [[8.8]{.underline}](#management-of-technical-vulnerabilities) and
> [[8.19]{.underline}](#installation-of-software-on-operational-systems)).
>
> Computer software can rely on externally supplied software and
> packages (e.g. software programs using modules which are hosted on
> external sites), which should be monitored and controlled to avoid
> unauthorized changes, because they can introduce information security
> vulnerabilities.
>
> Vendor supplied software used in operational systems should be
> maintained at a level supported by the supplier. Over time, software
> vendors will cease to support older versions of software. The
> organization should consider the risks of relying on unsupported
> software. Open source software used in operational systems should be
> maintained to the latest appropriate release of the software. Over
> time, open source code can cease to be maintained but is still
> available in an open source software repository. The organization
> should also consider the risks of relying on unmaintained open source
> software when used in operational systems.
>
> When suppliers are involved in installing or updating software,
> physical or logical access should only be given when necessary and
> with appropriate authorization. The supplier's activities should be
> monitored (see
> [[5.22]{.underline}](#monitoring-review-and-change-management-of-supplier-services)).
>
> The organization should define and enforce strict rules on which types
> of software users can install.
>
> The principle of least privilege should be applied to software
> installation on operational systems. The organization should identify
> what types of software installations are permitted (e.g. updates and
> security patches to existing software) and what types of installations
> are prohibited (e.g. software that is only for personal use and
> software whose pedigree with regard to being potentially malicious is

##### Control

> Networks and network devices should be secured, managed and controlled
> to protect information in systems and applications.

##### Purpose

> To protect information in networks and its supporting information
> processing facilities from compromise via the network.

##### Guidance

> Controls should be implemented to ensure the security of information
> in networks and to protect connected services from unauthorized
> access. In particular, the following items should be considered:

a)  the type and classification level of information that the network
    can support;

b)  establishing responsibilities and procedures for the management of
    networking equipment and devices;

c)  maintaining up to date documentation including network diagrams and
    configuration files of devices (e.g. routers, switches);

d)  separating operational responsibility for networks from ICT system
    > operations where appropriate

> (see [[5.3]{.underline}](#segregation-of-duties));

e)  establishing controls to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity
    of data passing over public networks, third-party networks or over
    wireless networks and to protect the connected systems and
    applications (see
    [[5.22]{.underline}](#monitoring-review-and-change-management-of-supplier-services),
    [[8.24]{.underline}](#use-of-cryptography),
    [[5.14]{.underline}](#information-transfer) and
    [[6.6]{.underline}](#confidentiality-or-non-disclosure-agreements)).
    Additional controls can also be required to maintain the
    availability of the network services and computers connected to the
    network;

f)  appropriately logging and monitoring to enable recording and
    > detection of actions that can affect, or are relevant to,
    > information security (see
    > [[8.16]{.underline}](#monitoring-activities) and
    > [[8.15]{.underline}](#logging));

g)  closely coordinating network management activities both to optimize
    > the service to the organization and to ensure that controls are
    > consistently applied across the information processing
    > infrastructure;

h)  authenticating systems on the network;

i)  restricting and filtering systems connection to the network (e.g.
    > using firewalls);

j)  detecting, restricting and authenticating the connection of
    > equipment and devices to the network;

k)  hardening of network devices;

l)  segregating network administration channels from other network
    > traffic;

m)  temporarily isolating critical subnetworks (e.g. with drawbridges)
    > if the network is under attack;

n)  disabling vulnerable network protocols.

> The organization should ensure that appropriate security controls are
> applied to the use of virtualized networks. Virtualized networks also
> cover software-defined networking (SDN, SD-WAN). Virtualized networks
> can be desirable from a security viewpoint, since they can permit
> logical separation of communication taking place over physical
> networks, particularly for systems and applications that are
> implemented using distributed computing.

##### Other information

##### Control

> Security mechanisms, service levels and service requirements of
> network services should be identified, implemented and monitored.

##### Purpose

> To ensure security in the use of network services.

##### Guidance

> The security measures necessary for particular services, such as
> security features, service levels and service requirements, should be
> identified and implemented (by internal or external network service
> providers). The organization should ensure that network service
> providers implement these measures.
>
> The ability of the network service provider to manage agreed services
> in a secure way should be determined and regularly monitored. The
> right to audit should be agreed between the organization and the
> provider. The organization should also consider third-party
> attestations provided by service providers to demonstrate they
> maintain appropriate security measures.
>
> Rules on the use of networks and network services should be formulated
> and implemented to cover:

a)  the networks and network services which are allowed to be accessed;

b)  authentication requirements for accessing various network services;

c)  authorization procedures for determining who is allowed to access
    which networks and networked services;

d)  network management and technological controls and procedures to
    > protect access to network connections and network services;

e)  the means used to access networks and network services \[e.g. use of
    > virtual private network (VPN) or wireless network\];

f)  time, location and other attributes of the user at the time of the
    > access;

g)  monitoring of the use of network services.

> The following security features of network services should be
> considered:

a)  technology applied for security of network services, such as
    authentication, encryption and network connection controls;

b)  technical parameters required for secured connection with the
    network services in accordance with the security and network
    connection rules;

c)  caching (e.g. in a content delivery network) and its parameters that
    allow users to choose the use of caching in accordance with
    performance, availability and confidentiality requirements;

d)  procedures for the network service usage to restrict access to
    network services or applications, where necessary.

##### Other information

> Network services include the provision of connections, private network
> services and managed network security solutions such as firewalls and
> intrusion detection systems. These services can range from simple
> unmanaged bandwidth to complex value-added offerings.

##### Control

> Groups of information services, users and information systems should
> be segregated in the organization's networks.

##### Purpose

> To split the network in security boundaries and to control traffic
> between them based on business
>
> needs.

##### Guidance

> The organization should consider managing the security of large
> networks by dividing them into separate network domains and separating
> them from the public network (i.e. internet). The domains can be
> chosen based on levels of trust, criticality and sensitivity (e.g.
> public access domain, desktop domain, server domain, low- and
> high-risk systems), along organizational units (e.g. human resources,
> finance, marketing) or some combination (e.g. server domain connecting
> to multiple organizational units). The segregation can be done using
> either physically different networks or by using different logical
> networks.
>
> The perimeter of each domain should be well-defined. If access between
> network domains is allowed, it should be controlled at the perimeter
> using a gateway (e.g. firewall, filtering router). The criteria for
>
> segregation of networks into domains, and the access allowed through
> the gateways, should be based on an assessment of the security
> requirements of each domain. The assessment should be in accordance
> with the topic-specific policy on access control (see
> [[5.15]{.underline}](#access-control)), access requirements, value and
> classification of information processed and take account of the
> relative cost and performance impact of incorporating suitable gateway
> technology.
>
> Wireless networks require special treatment due to the poorly-defined
> network perimeter. Radio coverage adjustment should be considered for
> segregation of wireless networks. For sensitive environments,
> consideration should be made to treat all wireless access as external
> connections and to segregate this access from internal networks until
> the access has passed through a gateway in accordance with network
> controls (see [[8.20]{.underline}](#networks-security)) before
> granting access to internal systems. Wireless access network for
> guests should be segregated from those for personnel if personnel only
> use controlled user endpoint devices compliant to the organization's
> topic-specific policies. WiFi for guests should have at least the same
> restrictions as WiFi for personnel, in order to discourage the use of
> guest WiFi by personnel.

##### Other information

> Networks often extend beyond organizational boundaries, as business
> partnerships are formed that require the interconnection or sharing of
> information processing and networking facilities. Such extensions can
> increase the risk of unauthorized access to the organization's
> information systems that use the network, some of which require
> protection from other network users because of their sensitivity or
> criticality.

##### Purpose

> To protect systems from being compromised by malware and to prevent
> access to unauthorized web
>
> resources.

##### Guidance

> The organization should reduce the risks of its personnel accessing
> websites that contain illegal information or are known to contain
> viruses or phishing material. A technique for achieving this works by
> blocking the IP address or domain of the website(s) concerned. Some
> browsers and anti-malware technologies do this automatically or can be
> configured to do so.
>
> The organization should identify the types of websites to which
> personnel should or should not have access. The organization should
> consider blocking access to the following types of websites:

a)  websites that have an information upload function unless permitted
    for valid business reasons;

b)  known or suspected malicious websites (e.g. those distributing
    malware or phishing contents);

c)  command and control servers;

d)  malicious website acquired from threat intelligence (see
    > [[5.7]{.underline}](#threat-intelligence));

e)  websites sharing illegal content.

> Prior to deploying this control, the organization should establish
> rules for safe and appropriate use of online resources, including any
> restriction to undesirable or inappropriate websites and web-based
> applications. The rules should be kept up-to-date.
>
> Training should be given to personnel on the secure and appropriate
> use of online resources including access to the web. The training
> should include the organization's rules, contact point for raising
> security concerns, and exception process when restricted web resources
> need to be accessed for legitimate business reasons. Training should
> also be given to personnel to ensure that they do not overrule any
> browser advisory that reports that a website is not secure but allows
> the user to proceed.

##### Control

> Rules for the effective use of cryptography, including cryptographic
> key management, should be defined and implemented.

##### Purpose

> To ensure proper and effective use of cryptography to protect the
> confidentiality, authenticity or integrity of information according to
> business and information security requirements, and taking into
> consideration legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual
> requirements related to cryptography.

##### Guidance

> [General]{.underline}
>
> When using cryptography, the following should be considered:

a)  the topic-specific policy on cryptography defined by the
    organization, including the general principles for the protection of
    information. A topic-specific policy on the use of cryptography is
    necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of using
    cryptographic techniques and to avoid inappropriate or incorrect
    use;

b)  identifying the required level of protection and the classification
    of the information and consequently establishing the type, strength
    and quality of the cryptographic algorithms required;

c)  the use of cryptography for protection of information held on mobile
    user endpoint devices or storage media and transmitted over networks
    to such devices or storage media;

d)  the approach to key management, including methods to deal with the
    generation and protection of cryptographic keys and the recovery of
    encrypted information in the case of lost, compromised or damaged
    keys;

e)  roles and responsibilities for:

    1.  the implementation of the rules for the effective use of
        cryptography;

    2.  the key management, including key generation (see
        > [[8.24]{.underline}](#use-of-cryptography));

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
f)  the standards to be adopted, as well as cryptographic algorithms,
    cipher strength, cryptographic solutions and usage practices that
    are approved or required for use in the organization;

g)  the impact of using encrypted information on controls that rely on
    content inspection (e.g. malware detection or content filtering).

> When implementing the organization's rules for effective use of
> cryptography, the regulations and national restrictions that can apply
> to the use of cryptographic techniques in different parts of the world
> should be taken into consideration as well as the issues of
> trans-border flow of encrypted information (see
> [[5.31]{.underline}](#legal-statutory-regulatory-and-contractual-requirements)).
>
> The contents of service level agreements or contracts with external
> suppliers of cryptographic services (e.g. with a certification
> authority) should cover issues of liability, reliability of services
> and response times for the provision of services (see
> [[5.22]{.underline}](#monitoring-review-and-change-management-of-supplier-services)).
>
> [Key management]{.underline}

> Appropriate key management requires secure processes for generating,
> storing, archiving, retrieving, distributing, retiring and destroying
> cryptographic keys.
>
> A key management system should be based on an agreed set of standards,

> methods for:

a)  generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different
    applications;

b)  issuing and obtaining public key certificates;

c)  distributing keys to intended entities, including how to activate
    keys when received;

d)  storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys;

e)  changing or updating keys including rules on when to change keys and
    how this will be done;

f)  dealing with compromised keys;

g)  revoking keys including how to withdraw or deactivate keys \[e.g.
    when keys have been compromised or when a user leaves an
    organization (in which case keys should also be archived)\];

h)  recovering keys that are lost or corrupted;

i)  backing up or archiving keys;

j)  destroying keys;

k)  logging and auditing of key management related activities;

l)  setting activation and deactivation dates for keys so that the keys
    can only be used for the period of time according to the
    organization\'s rules on key management;

m)  handling legal requests for access to cryptographic keys (e.g.
    encrypted information can be required to be made available in an
    unencrypted form as evidence in a court case).

> All cryptographic keys should be protected against modification and
> loss. In addition, secret and private keys need protection against
> unauthorized use as well as disclosure. Equipment used to generate,
> store and archive keys should be physically protected.
>
> In addition to integrity, for many use cases, the authenticity of
> public keys should also be considered.

##### Other information

> The authenticity of public keys is usually addressed by public key
> management processes using certificate authorities and public key
> certificates, but it is also possible to address it by using
> technologies such as applying manual processes for small number keys.
>
> Cryptography can be used to achieve different information security
> objectives, for example:

a.  confidentiality: using encryption of information to protect
    sensitive or critical information, either stored or transmitted;

b.  integrity or authenticity: using digital signatures or message
    authentication codes to verify the authenticity or integrity of
    stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information. Using
    algorithms for the purpose of file integrity checking;

c.  non-repudiation: using cryptographic techniques to provide evidence
    of the occurrence or non- occurrence of an event or action;

d.  authentication: using cryptographic techniques to authenticate users
    and other system entities requesting access to or transacting with
    system users, entities and resources.

a)  the level of trust each party requires in each other's claimed
    identity;

b)  the level of trust required in the integrity of information
    exchanged or processed and the mechanisms for identification of lack

    signatures);

c)  authorization processes associated with who can approve contents of,
    issue or sign key transactional documents;

d)  confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and receipt of key
    documents and the non-repudiation (e.g. contracts associated with
    tendering and contract processes);

e)  the confidentiality and integrity of any transactions (e.g. orders,
    delivery address details and confirmation of receipts);

f)  requirements on how long to maintain a transaction confidential;

g)  insurance and other contractual requirements. [Electronic ordering

a)  requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of
    order information;

b)  the degree of verification appropriate to verify payment information
    supplied by a customer;

c)  avoidance of loss or duplication of transaction information;

d)  storing transaction details outside of any publicly accessible
    environment (e.g. on a storage platform existing on the
    organizational intranet, and not retained and exposed on electronic
    storage media directly accessible from the internet);

e)  where a trusted authority is used (e.g. for the purposes of issuing

##### Control

> Principles for engineering secure systems should be established,
> documented, maintained and applied to any information system
> development activities.

##### Purpose

> To ensure information systems are securely designed, implemented and
> operated within the development life cycle.

##### Guidance

> Security engineering principles should be established, documented and
> applied to information system engineering activities. Security should
> be designed into all architecture layers (business, data, applications
> and technology). New technology should be analysed for security risks
> and the design should be reviewed against known attack patterns.
>
> Secure engineering principles provide guidance on user authentication
> techniques, secure session control and data validation and
> sanitisation.
>
> Secure system engineering principles should include analysis of:

a)  the full range of security controls required to protect information
    and systems against identified threats;

b)  the capabilities of security controls to prevent, detect or respond
    to security events;

c)  specific security controls required by particular business processes
    (e.g. encryption of sensitive information, integrity checking and
    digitally signing information);

d)  where and how security controls are to be applied (e.g. by
    integrating with a security architecture and the technical
    infrastructure);

e)  how individual security controls (manual and automated) work
    together to produce an integrated

> set of controls.
>
> Security engineering principles should take account of:

a)  the need to integrate with a security architecture;

b)  technical security infrastructure \[e.g. public key infrastructure
    > (PKI), identity and access management (IAM), data leakage
    > prevention and dynamic access management\];

c)  capability of the organization to develop and support the chosen
    > technology;

d)  cost, time and complexity of meeting security requirements;

e)  current good practices.

> Secure system engineering should involve:

a)  the use of security architecture principles, such as "security by
    design", "defence in depth", "security by default", "default deny",
    "fail securely", "distrust input from external applications",
    "security in deployment", "assume breach", \"least privilege\",
    "usability and manageability" and "least functionality";

b)  a security-oriented design review to help identify information
    security vulnerabilities, ensure security controls are specified and
    meet security requirements;

c)  documentation and formal acknowledgement of security controls that
    do not fully meet requirements (e.g. due to overriding safety
    requirements);

d)  hardening of systems.

> The organization should consider \"zero trust\" principles such as:

a)  assuming the organization's information systems are already breached
    and thus not be reliant on network perimeter security alone;

b)  employing a "never trust and always verify" approach for access to
    information systems;

c)  ensuring that requests to information systems are encrypted
    end-to-end;

d)  verifying each request to an information system as if it originated
    from an open, external network, even if these requests originated
    internal to the organization (i.e. not automatically trusting
    anything inside or outside its perimeters);

e)  using \"least privilege\" and dynamic access control techniques (see
    [[5.15]{.underline}](#access-control),
    [[5.18]{.underline}](#access-rights) and
    [[8.2]{.underline}](#privileged-access-rights)). This includes
    authenticating and authorizing requests for information or to
    systems based on contextual information such as authentication
    information (see [[5.17]{.underline}](#authentication-information)),
    user identities (see [[5.16]{.underline}](#identity-management)),
    data about the user endpoint device, and data classification (see
    [[5.12]{.underline}](#classification-of-information));

f)  always authenticating requesters and always validating authorization
    requests to information systems based on information including
    authentication information (see
    [[5.17]{.underline}](#authentication-information)) and user
    identities ([[5.16]{.underline}](#identity-management)), data about
    the user endpoint device, and data classification (see
    [[5.12]{.underline}](#classification-of-information)), for example
    enforcing strong authentication (e.g. multi-factor, see
    [[8.5]{.underline}](#secure-authentication)).

> The established security engineering principles should be applied,
> where applicable, to outsourced development of information systems
> through the contracts and other binding agreements between the
> organization and the supplier to whom the organization outsources. The
> organization should ensure that suppliers' security engineering
> practices align with the organization's needs.
>
> The security engineering principles and the established engineering
> procedures should be regularly reviewed to ensure that they are
> effectively contributing to enhanced standards of security within the
> engineering process. They should also be regularly reviewed to ensure
> that they remain up-to- date in terms of combatting any new potential
> threats and in remaining applicable to advances in the technologies
> and solutions being applied.

##### Other information

> Secure engineering principles can be applied to the design or
> configuration of a range of techniques, such as:

-   fault tolerance and other resilience techniques;

-   segregation (e.g. through virtualization or containerization);

-   tamper resistance.

> Secure virtualization techniques can be used to prevent interference
> between applications running on the same physical device. If a virtual
> instance of an application is compromised by an attacker, only that
> instance is affected. The attack has no effect on any other
> application or data.
>
> Tamper resistance techniques can be used to detect tampering of
> information containers, whether physical (e.g. a burglar alarm) or
> logical (e.g. a data file). A characteristic of such techniques is
> that there is a record of the attempt to tamper with the container. In
> addition, the control can prevent the successful extraction of data
> through its destruction (e.g. device memory can be deleted).

##### Control

> Secure coding principles should be applied to software development.

##### Purpose

> To ensure software is written securely thereby reducing the number of
> potential information security vulnerabilities in the software.

##### Guidance

> [General]{.underline}
>
> The organization should establish organization-wide processes to
> provide good governance for secure coding. A minimum secure baseline
> should be established and applied. Additionally, such processes and
> governance should be extended to cover software components from third
> parties and open source software.
>
> The organization should monitor real world threats and up-to-date
> advice and information on software vulnerabilities to guide the
> organization's secure coding principles through continual improvement
> and learning. This can help with ensuring effective secure coding
> practices are implemented to combat the fast-changing threat
> landscape.
>
> [Planning and before coding]{.underline}
>
> Secure coding principles should be used both for new developments and
> in reuse scenarios. These principles should be applied to development
> activities both within the organization and for products and services
> supplied by the organization to others. Planning and prerequisites
> before coding should include:

a)  organization-specific expectations and approved principles for
    secure coding to be used for both in-house and outsourced code
    developments;

b)  common and historical coding practices and defects that lead to
    information security vulnerabilities;

c)  configuring development tools, such as integrated development
    > environments (IDE), to help enforce the creation of secure code;

d)  following guidance issued by the providers of development tools and
    > execution environments as applicable;

e)  maintenance and use of updated development tools (e.g. compilers);

f)  qualification of developers in writing secure code;

g)  secure design and architecture, including threat modelling;

h)  secure coding standards and where relevant mandating their use;

i)  use of controlled environments for development. [During
    > coding]{.underline}

> Considerations during coding should include:

a)  secure coding practices specific to the programming languages and
    techniques being used;

b)  using secure programming techniques, such as pair programming,
    refactoring, peer review, security iterations and test-driven
    development;

c)  using structured programming techniques;

d)  documenting code and removing programming defects, which can allow
    information security vulnerabilities to be exploited;

e)  prohibiting the use of insecure design techniques (e.g. the use of
    hard-coded passwords, unapproved code samples and unauthenticated
    web services).

> Testing should be conducted during and after development (see
> [[8.29]{.underline}](#security-testing-in-development-and-acceptance)).
> Static application security testing (SAST) processes can identify
> security vulnerabilities in software.
>
> Before software is made operational, the following should be
> evaluated:

a)  attack surface and the principle of least privilege;

b)  conducting an analysis of the most common programming errors and
    documenting that these have been mitigated.

> [Review and maintenance]{.underline}
>
> After code has been made operational:

a)  updates should be securely packaged and deployed;

b)  reported information security vulnerabilities should be handled (see
    [[8.8]{.underline}](#management-of-technical-vulnerabilities));

c)  errors and suspected attacks should be logged and logs regularly
    reviewed to make adjustments to the code as necessary;

d)  source code should be protected against unauthorized access and
    tampering (e.g. by using configuration management tools, which
    typically provide features such as access control and version
    control).

> If using external tools and libraries, the organization should
> consider:

a)  ensuring that external libraries are managed (e.g. by maintaining an
    inventory of libraries used and their versions) and regularly
    updated with release cycles;

b)  selection, authorization and reuse of well-vetted components,
    > particularly authentication and cryptographic components;

c)  the licence, security and history of external components;

d)  ensuring that software is maintainable, tracked and originates from
    > proven, reputable sources;

e)  sufficiently long-term availability of development resources and
    > artefacts.

> Where a software package needs to be modified the following points
> should be considered:

a)  the risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being
    compromised;

b)  whether to obtain the consent of the vendor;

c)  the possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as
    standard program updates;

d)  the impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future
    maintenance of the software as a result of changes;

e)  compatibility with other software in use.

##### Other information

> A guiding principle is to ensure security-relevant code is invoked
> when necessary and is tamper- resistant. Programs installed from
> compiled binary code also have these properties but only for data held
> within the application. For interpreted languages, the concept only
> works when the code is executed on a server that is otherwise
> inaccessible by the users and processes that use it, and that its data
> is held in a similarly protected database. For example, the
> interpreted code can be run on a cloud service where access to the
> code itself requires administrator privileges. Such administrator
> access should be protected by security mechanisms such as just-in-time
> administration principles and strong authentication. If the
> application owner can access scripts by direct remote access to the
> server, so in principle can an attacker. Webservers should be
> configured to prevent directory browsing in such cases.
>
> Application code is best designed on the assumption that it is always
> subject to attack, through error or malicious action. In addition,
> critical applications can be designed to be tolerant of internal
> faults. For example, the output from a complex algorithm can be
> checked to ensure that it lies within safe bounds before the data is
> used in an application such as a safety or financial critical
> application. The code that performs the boundary checks is simple and
> therefore much easier to prove correctness.
>
> Some web applications are susceptible to a variety of vulnerabilities
> that are introduced by poor design and coding, such as database
> injection and cross-site scripting attacks. In these attacks, requests
> can be manipulated to abuse the webserver functionality.

>
> Security testing should be conducted against a set of requirements,

a)  security functions \[e.g. user authentication (see
    [[8.5]{.underline}](#secure-authentication)), access restriction
    (see [[8.3]{.underline}](#information-access-restriction)) and use
    of cryptography (see [[8.24]{.underline}](#use-of-cryptography))\];

b)  secure coding (see [[8.28]{.underline}](#secure-coding));

c)  secure configurations (see
    [[8.9]{.underline}](#configuration-management),
    [[8.20]{.underline}](#networks-security) and
    [[8.22]{.underline}](#segregation-of-networks)) including that of

> Test plans should be determined using a set of criteria. The extent of
> testing should be in proportion to the importance, nature of the

> test plan should include:

a)  detailed schedule of activities and tests;

b)  inputs and expected outputs under a range of conditions;

c)  criteria to evaluate the results;

d)  decision for further actions as necessary.

> The organization can leverage automated tools, such as code analysis
> tools or vulnerability scanners, and should verify the remediation of

>
> For in-house developments, such tests should initially be performed by
> the development team. Independent acceptance testing should then be
> undertaken to ensure that the system works as expected and only as
> expected (see
> [[5.8]{.underline}](#information-security-in-project-management)). The

a)  performing code review activities as a relevant element for testing
    for security flaws, including un- anticipated inputs and conditions;

b)  performing vulnerability scanning to identify insecure
    configurations and system vulnerabilities;

c)  performing penetration testing to identify insecure code and design.

> For outsourced development and purchasing components, an acquisition
> process should be followed. Contracts with the supplier should address
> the identified security requirements (see
> [[5.20]{.underline}](#addressing-information-security-within-supplier-agreements)).
> Products and services should be evaluated against these criteria

f)  provision of evidence that sufficient testing has been applied to
    guard against the presence of malicious content (both intentional
    and unintentional) upon delivery;

g)  provision of evidence that sufficient testing has been applied to
    guard against the presence of known vulnerabilities;

h)  escrow agreements for the software source code (e.g. if the supplier
    goes out of business);

i)  contractual right to audit development processes and controls;

j)  security requirements for the development environment (see
    [[8.31]{.underline}](#separation-of-development-test-and-production-environments));

k)  taking consideration of applicable legislation (e.g. on protection
    of personal data).

##### Control

> Development, testing and production environments should be separated
> and secured.

##### Purpose

> To protect the production environment and data from compromise by
> development and test activities.

##### Guidance

> The level of separation between production, testing and development
> environments that is necessary to prevent production problems should
> be identified and implemented.
>
> The following items should be considered:

a)  adequately separating development and production systems and
    operating them in different domains (e.g. in separate virtual or
    physical environments);

b)  defining, documenting and implementing rules and authorization for
    the deployment of software from development to production status;

c)  testing changes to production systems and applications in a testing
    or staging environment prior to being applied to production systems
    (see
    [[8.29]{.underline}](#security-testing-in-development-and-acceptance));

d)  not testing in production environments except in circumstances that
    have been defined and approved;

e)  compilers, editors and other development tools or utility programs
    not being accessible from production systems when not required;

f)  displaying appropriate environment identification labels in menus to
    reduce the risk of error;

g)  not copying sensitive information into the development and testing
    system environments unless equivalent controls are provided for the
    development and testing systems.

> In all cases, development and testing environments should be protected
> considering:

a)  patching and updating of all the development, integration and
    testing tools (including builders, integrators, compilers,
    configuration systems and libraries);

b)  secure configuration of systems and software;

c)  control of access to the environments;

d)  monitoring of change to the environment and code stored therein;

e)  secure monitoring of the environments;

f)  taking backups of the environments.

> A single person should not have the ability to make changes to both
> development and production without prior review and approval. This can
> be achieved for example through segregation of access rights or
> through rules that are monitored. In exceptional situations,
> additional measures such as detailed logging and real-time monitoring
> should be implemented in order to detect and act on unauthorized
> changes.

##### Other information

> Without adequate measures and procedures, developers and testers
> having access to production systems can introduce significant risks
> (e.g. unwanted modification of files or system environment, system
> failure, running unauthorized and untested code in production systems,
> disclosure of confidential data, data integrity and availability
> issues). There is a need to maintain a known and stable environment in
> which to perform meaningful testing and to prevent inappropriate
> developer access to the production environment.
>
> Measures and procedures include carefully designed roles in
> conjunction with implementing segregation of duty requirements and
> having adequate monitoring processes in place.
>
> Development and testing personnel also pose a threat to the
> confidentiality of production information. Development and testing
> activities can cause unintended changes to software or information if
> they share the same computing environment. Separating development,
> testing and production environments is therefore desirable to reduce
> the risk of accidental change or unauthorized access to production
> software and business data (see
> [[8.33]{.underline}](#test-information) for the protection of test
> information).
>
> In some cases, the distinction between development, test and
> production environments can be deliberately blurred and testing can be
> carried out in a development environment or through controlled
> rollouts to live users or servers (e.g. small population of pilot
> users). In some cases, product testing can occur through live use of
> the product inside the organization. Furthermore, to reduce downtime
> of live deployments, two identical production environments can be
> supported where only one is live at any one time.
>
> Supporting processes for the use of production data in development and
> testing environments ([[8.33]{.underline}](#test-information)) are
> necessary.
>
> Organizations can also consider the guidance provided in this section
> for training environments when conducting end user training.

##### Control

> Changes to information processing facilities and information systems
> should be subject to change management procedures.

##### Purpose

> To preserve information security when executing changes.

##### Guidance

> Introduction of new systems and major changes to existing systems
> should follow agreed rules and a formal process of documentation,
> specification, testing, quality control and managed implementation.
> Management responsibilities and procedures should be in place to
> ensure satisfactory control of all changes.
>
> Change control procedures should be documented and enforced to ensure
> the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information in
> information processing facilities and information systems, for the
> entire system development life cycle from the early design stages
> through all subsequent maintenance efforts.
>
> Wherever practicable, change control procedures for ICT infrastructure
> and software should be integrated.
>
> The change control procedures should include:

a)  planning and assessing the potential impact of changes considering
    all dependencies;

b)  authorization of changes;

c)  communicating changes to relevant interested parties;

d)  tests and acceptance of tests for the changes (see
    > [[8.29]{.underline}](#security-testing-in-development-and-acceptance));

e)  implementation of changes including deployment plans;

f)  emergency and contingency considerations including fall-back
    procedures;

g)  maintaining records of changes that include all of the above;

h)  ensuring that operating documentation (see
    [[5.37]{.underline}](#documented-operating-procedures)) and user
    procedures are changed as necessary to remain appropriate;

i)  ensuring that ICT continuity plans and response and recovery
    procedures (see
    [[5.30]{.underline}](#ict-readiness-for-business-continuity)) are
    changed as necessary to remain appropriate.

##### Other information

> Inadequate control of changes to information processing facilities and
> information systems is a common cause of system or security failures.
> Changes to the production environment, especially when transferring
> software from development to operational environment, can impact on
> the integrity and availability of applications.
>
> Changing software can impact the production environment and vice
> versa.
>
> Good practice includes the testing of ICT components in an environment
> segregated from both the production and development environments (see
> [[8.31]{.underline}](#separation-of-development-test-and-production-environments)).
> This provides a means of having control over new software and allowing
> additional protection of operational information that is used for
> testing purposes. This should include patches, service packs and other
> updates.
>
> Production environment includes operating systems, databases and
> middleware platforms. The control should be applied for changes of
> applications and infrastructures.

##### Control

> Test information should be appropriately selected, protected and
> managed.

##### Purpose

> To ensure relevance of testing and protection of operational
> information used for testing.

##### Guidance

> Test information should be selected to ensure the reliability of tests
> results and the confidentiality of the relevant operational
> information. Sensitive information (including personally identifiable
> information) should not be copied into the development and testing
> environments (see
> [[8.31]{.underline}](#separation-of-development-test-and-production-environments)).
>
> The following guidelines should be applied to protect the copies of
> operational information, when used for testing purposes, whether the
> test environment is built in-house or on a cloud service:

a)  applying the same access control procedures to test environments as
    those applied to operational environments;

b)  having a separate authorization each time operational information is
    copied to a test environment;

c)  logging the copying and use of operational information to provide an
    audit trail;

d)  protecting sensitive information by removal or masking (see
    > [[8.11]{.underline}](#data-masking)) if used for testing;

e)  properly deleting (see [[8.10]{.underline}](#information-deletion))
    operational information from a test environment immediately after
    the testing is complete to prevent unauthorized use of test
    information.

> Test information should be securely stored (to prevent tampering,
> which can otherwise lead to invalid results) and only used for testing
> purposes.

##### Other information

> System and acceptance testing can require substantial volumes of test
> information that are as close as possible to operational information.

##### Control

> Audit tests and other assurance activities involving assessment of
> operational systems should be planned and agreed between the tester
> and appropriate management.

##### Purpose

> To minimize the impact of audit and other assurance activities on
> operational systems and business
>
> processes.

##### Guidance

> The following guidelines should be observed:

a)  agreeing audit requests for access to systems and data with
    appropriate management;

b)  agreeing and controlling the scope of technical audit tests;

c)  limiting audit tests to read-only access to software and data. If
    read-only access is not available to obtain the necessary
    information, executing the test by an experienced administrator who
    has the necessary access rights on behalf of the auditor;

d)  if access is granted, establishing and verifying the security
    requirements (e.g. antivirus and patching) of the devices used for
    accessing the systems (e.g. laptops or tablets) before allowing the
    access;

e)  only allowing access other than read-only for isolated copies of
    system files, deleting them when the audit is completed, or giving
    them appropriate protection if there is an obligation to keep such
    files under audit documentation requirements;

f)  identifying and agreeing on requests for special or additional
    > processing, such as running audit tools;

g)  running audit tests that can affect system availability outside
    > business hours;

h)  monitoring and logging all access for audit and test purposes.

##### Other information

> Audit tests and other assurance activities can also happen on
> development and test systems, where such tests can impact for example
> the integrity of code or lead to disclosure of any sensitive
> information held in such environments.

Organizational views
--------------------

> Since attributes are used to create different views of controls,
> organizations can discard the examples of attributes proposed in this
> document and create their own attributes with different values to
> address specific needs in the organization. In addition, the values
> assigned to each attribute can differ between organizations since
> organizations can have different views on the use or applicability of
> the control or of the values associated to the attribute (when the
> values are specific to the context of the
>
> organization). The first step is to understand why an
> organizational-specific attribute is desirable. For example, if an
> organization has constructed its risk treatment plans \[see ISO/IEC
> 27001:2013, 6.1.3 e)\] based on events, it can wish to associate a
> risk scenario attribute to each control in this document.
>
> The benefit of such an attribute is to speed up the process of
> fulfilment of ISO/IEC 27001 requirement related to risk treatment,
> which is to compare the controls determined through the process of
> risk treatment (referred to as "necessary" controls), with those in
> ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Annex A (which are issued from in this document)
> to ensure that no necessary control has been overlooked.
>
> Once the purpose and benefits are known, the next step is to determine
> the attribute values. For example, the organization might identify 9
> events:

1)  loss or theft of mobile device;

2)  loss or theft from organization's premises;

3)  force majeure, vandalism and terrorism;

4)  failure of software, hardware, power, internet and communications;

5)  fraud;

6)  hacking;

7)  disclosure;

8)  breach of the law;

9)  social engineering.

> The second step can therefore be accomplished by assigning identifiers
> to each event (e.g. E1, E2, \..., E9).
>
> The third step is to copy the control identifiers and control names
> from this document into a spreadsheet or database and associate the
> attribute values with each control, remembering that each control can
> have more than one attribute value.
>
> The final step is to sort the spreadsheet or query the database to
> extract the required information. Other examples of organizational
> attributes (and possible values) include:

a.  maturity (values from the ISO/IEC 33000 series or other maturity
    > models);

b.  implementation state (to do, in progress, partially implemented,
    > fully implemented);

c.  priority (1, 2, 3, etc.);

d.  organizational areas involved (security, ICT, human resources, top
    > management, etc.);

e.  events;

f.  assets involved;

> e\) build and run, to differentiate controls used in the different
> steps of the service life cycle;

g.  other frameworks the organization works with or can be transitioning
    > from.
