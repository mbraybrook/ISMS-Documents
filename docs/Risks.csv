If we continue with our current risk assessment processes despite the business expansion and strategic changes we run a real risk of missing or misidentifying potential risks and not planning appropriately for them.","Current risk assessments include the company MD, who has full oversight of all business changes and strategy allowing us to account for this in the consultations used to gather risk assessment information and ratify findings.",1,1,2,4,2,8,Retain,,,,,,,,,,"A.5.1, A.5.35"
61,Apr-23,,CISO,Personal Data,,New staff adhering to data protection standards.,"If a new member of staff doesn't follow the established data protection standards and protections, they could do something like export personal data to an insecure location and share this to places it should not be shared.
Senior members of staff might be able to assert authority to bypass security protections and this would be wrong and should be prevented.
