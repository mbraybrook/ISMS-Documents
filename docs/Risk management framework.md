1.  **Scope**

> Paythru Ltd's risk management framework applies to all risks in the
> business plan, as identified in clause 6.1 of the Manual.

2.  **Responsibilities**

> The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for
> ensuring that Paythru Ltd's risk management framework meets the
> requirements of the Board of Directors and of both ISO 27001 and PCI
> DSS.

3.  **Objectives**

> These objectives determine Paythru's key intentions for identifying
> and managing risk:

-   To design and execute a business risk management process which
    integrates with Paythru's business strategies:

-   Integrate business risk management with our strategy formulation and
    business planning processes.

-   Articulate our strategies so that they are understood throughout our
    organisation.

-   Reward effective articulation and management of key risks.

-   Ensure that process ownership questions are addressed with clarity,
    so that roles, responsibilities and authority are properly
    understood.

-   Design and execute a process to monitor and reassess the risk
    profile, and identify gaps in the management of those risks, based
    upon changes in business objectives and in the external and internal
    operating environment.

-   Define risk management strategies and clear accountabilities and
    action steps for building and executing risk management capabilities
    and improving them continuously.

-   Continuously monitor the information provided to decision-makers in
    order to assist them as they manage key risks and protect the
    interests of shareholders.

-   To identify and evaluate risks to information assets.

-   To implement appropriate controls to mitigate identified risks.

-   To ensure compliance with ISO 27001:2022 requirements.

-   To continuously monitor and review risks and controls.

4.  **Definitions**

> **Risk **
>
> A risk is defined as the probable frequency or magnitude of potential
> loss, harm or damage to Paythru's assets because of a vulnerability.
>
> **Asset**
>
> An asset is defined as something of value to Paythru. Information
> assets are a combination of physical and logical which can be grouped
> into specific categories.
>
> **Impact**
>
> Impact is defined as a marked effect of influence on Paythru's assets,
> network or business functions because of a change or security breach.
>
> **Control**
>
> Paythru defines controls as measures, actions and processes which
> directly affect the severity of harm or loss to their assets.
>
> **Residual Risk**
>
> Residual risk refers to the risk which remains after Paythru has
> decided on and implemented the right management controls.
>
> **Risk Appetite **
>
> This is the amount of risk which Paythru is happy to accept and
> tolerate in order to achieve our strategy objectives.
>
> **Vulnerabilities**
>
> Vulnerabilities are any gaps which exist in the management controls in
> place to protect an asset from threats and risk.
>
> **Threats **
>
> Threats are anything which can exploit the vulnerabilities of assets
> (whether intentional or accidentally), which obtain, damage or
> contaminate Paythru's assets.

5.  **Procedure**

> Each quarter Paythru conducts a risk assessment to review all
> appropriate risks, existing and new, to see if the risk profile has
> changed, if any new controls are required and if any associated
> documentation needs to be updated.
>
> These reviews are carried out by senior management and with relevant
> consultation with interested parties, including Asset Owners, to
> ensure that all contractual, regulatory and legislative requirements
> are covered.
>
> Risks are scored by independently considering their impact on
> Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
>
> Risks considered by Paythru as a part of their overall approach to
> risk are those which fit at least one of the following criteria:

-   They affect something considered to have value to the company,
    either financial, competitive edge or reputational.

-   The risk, if realised, would have a direct detrimental effect on the
    business (i.e. the loss of some asset of value).

-   The risk is considered at least realistic. i.e. it is relevant to
    our business or could reasonably be expected to happen, for example
    we will not include volcanic eruption as a part of our risk
    assessment as our operations aren't located near any volcanically
    active areas.

> Risks are assessed according to their operational or financial impact
> on the business, combined with the likelihood of them occurring. The
> impact and likelihood are multiplied to get an overall score. The
> levels of impact are established by senior management.
>
> Items are rated according to the below graph:

               Min   Max   
  ------------ ----- ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Low**      3     14    the risk is acceptable to Paythru and does not require (further) treatment.
  **Medium**   15    35    the risk result is in 'warn' status. The risk may be acceptable in the absence of a cost-effective mitigation, but the risk may be reviewed more frequently.
  **High**     36    75    the risk result is unacceptable, and a risk treatment must be agreed and implemented.

> Risks are treated with one of the following 4 responses:

-   **Modify** -- a control is planned or put in place which mitigates
    the impact, likelihood or both associated with the risk and,
    ultimately, grants it a lower overall score.

-   **Share** -- typically through insurance, this represents a risk
    which we cannot appropriately control but for which we can transfer
    some of the risk to a third party.

-   **Retain** -- if the risk is considered acceptable, available
    mitigation is not cost-effective or there are no mitigation options
    available Paythru may choose to accept the risk as it is without
    treatment.

-   **Avoid** -- remove the risk by removing the asset or process which
    introduces the risk.

> Risk assessments are recorded using a standardised format in an Excel
> document which ensures consistency in reporting.

6.  **Threat Intelligence Process**

> This outlines the principles and procedures of gathering, analysing,
> and disseminating threat intelligence within Paythru. The aim is to
> proactively identify, understand, and mitigate potential threats to
> our IT infrastructure, data, operations, and/or processes. This is
> applicable to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries,
> and other workers at Paythru including those affiliated with third
> parties who access Paythru's computer network, IT systems, data, and
> information systems.

**Threat Intelligence Sources**
-------------------------------

-   Internal security logs and incident reports (Vulnerability scans,
    > and applicable system logs etc).

-   Industry forums and communities.

-   Approved open-source intelligence (OSINT) sources.

-   Government advisories and vulnerability alerts (ICO, CISP, NCSC
    > etc).

-   Bullphish (Darkweb ID) is used by Utilize on behalf of Paythru to
    > scan the dark web.

**Collection and Analysis**
---------------------------

> Threat intelligence will be collected from various sources mentioned
> above.
>
> Collected data will be stored securely and accessed only by authorised
> personnel.
>
> The CISO will analyse the data to identify relevant threats, assess
> their potential impact, and determine appropriate mitigation
> strategies.
>
> **Dissemination**
>
> Relevant threat intelligence will be disseminated to
> stakeholders/personnel according to the need-to-know basis. The method
> of dissemination will include (but is not limited to) reports, email
> alerts, and threat briefings (could be via online chats). Information
> will be tailored to the specific needs and responsibilities of each
> recipient.
>
> **Awareness and Training**
>
> Regular training will be conducted to educate employees about cyber
> threats and their role in reporting suspicious activity.
>
> Awareness campaigns will keep employees informed about current threats
> and vulnerabilities; Employees and personnel are expected to keep
> abreast with relevant threat intelligence sources and notify the
> Leadership Team for further review.

7.  **Compliance**

> Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action,
> up to and including termination of contract or employment.
