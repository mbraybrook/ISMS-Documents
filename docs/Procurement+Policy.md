+------------------+-------------+--------------+------------------+

Scope
-----

This policy outlines the procedures and guidelines for the procurement
of goods and services, including the evaluation, engagement, and renewal
of suppliers. The policy ensures compliance with PCI DSS and ISO 27001,
safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
Paythru's information assets and protected cardholder data.

If a supplier may store, process, or transmit cardholder data on behalf
of the company, it is necessary to ensure that the requirements of the
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) are met and
adhered to. Additionally, we monitor the PCI compliance of entities
which may process cardholder data on behalf of our clients (e.g. the
acquirers and payment gateways which we send cardholder data to for
transaction processing).

The steps associated with this policy focus on identifying the relevant
compliance requirements of a supplier and ensuring all appropriate
checks are completed, recorded, and updated.

Objectives
----------

Paythru is committed to providing a secure and reliable service meeting
appropriate certification requirements. Relationships with suppliers,
business partners, and third parties are entered into after appropriate
checks have been undertaken, ensuring that Paythru security levels are
not breached. The objectives of this policy are to:

-   Ensure suppliers adhere to the appropriate levels of security
    associated with the service being provided.

-   Ensure suppliers comply with Paythru\'s policies, legal requirements
    as necessary, and information security standards.

-   Identify the risks associated with using a supplier and manage these
    risks to an acceptable level.

-   Ensure the roles and responsibilities of suppliers are clearly
    defined and adhered to.

-   Ensure that relationships with suppliers, partners, and third
    parties do not compromise Paythru\'s ability to achieve PCI DSS
    Compliance.

-   Ensure suppliers adhere to security standards and certification
    requirements, including ISO 27001.

Supplier Type
-------------

Suppliers are recognised as one of three types:

-   **Connected Entity:** Suppliers provide a service that potentially
    involves the storing, processing, or transmitting of cardholder data
    on behalf of the company or in relation to our business operations.
    Typically an acquirer contracted by one of our clients.

-   **PCI Service Provider:** Suppliers or Service Providers with which
    either PCI account data is shared or whom could affect the security
    of our cardholder data. These suppliers must have their PCI
    attestation of compliance checked at least every 12 months, and upon
    expiry.

-   **Service Provider:** Suppliers offer a function, facility, or
    product that supports the systems and processes required to
    undertake day-to-day business at Paythru.

### Risk Identification and Handling

The risk of a supplier is compared with its supplier type to determine
the base level of checks performed against the supplier.

### Documentation and Evidence Requirements

All supplier criticality assessments must be documented and retained
using standardised templates, which must include:

-   Defined criteria and rationale for the assigned criticality rating

-   Relevant supporting evidence (e.g., service descriptions, impact
    analysis, risk assessments)

-   Completed risk scoring and decision matrices, where applicable

-   Documentation of who performed and approved the assessment

-   Escalation procedures and evidence when a supplier's criticality
    changes

### Integration with Existing Risk and Compliance Frameworks

Supplier criticality ratings and related reviews must be integrated with
the following processes:

-   CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) impact assessments

-   Supplier type classifications (Service Provider, Connected Entity,
    PCI Service Provider)

-   ISO 27001 requirements for supplier evaluations and monitoring

-   PCI DSS requirements, including annual compliance checks for
    applicable suppliers

Criticality ratings and supporting documentation should be referenced in
all relevant risk, compliance, and supplier management activities.

### Application and Review Workflow

1.  Review current supplier classifications and available information.

2.  Apply the defined criticality assessment criteria to each supplier.

3.  Document the assessment rationale and evidence in the approved
    template.

4.  Determine and schedule reviews according to assigned criticality.

5.  Update the supplier profile and relevant registers with criticality,
    documentation, and review dates.

6.  For any criticality change, follow escalation and document approval
    as required.

Legal, ISMS, or risk specialists must validate assessments for High
Criticality suppliers and when material changes or incidents occur.

Policy Administration
---------------------

This policy is administered and maintained by the Chief Information
Security Officer (CISO) and should be applied to all decisions involving
the procurement of all Connected Entities, PCI Service Providers, and
Service Providers.

A list of approved suppliers must be maintained as a reference point for
all Paythru staff.

Connected Entities and PCI Service Providers are administered and
maintained by the CISO. Service Providers are administered and
maintained by the Technical Support Manager. Any service that has the
potential to impact Paythru\'s PCI DSS Compliance must conform to this
policy and be agreed upon by the CISO. In the absence of the CISO,
approval is passed to the Managing Director.

Supplier Selection and Evaluation
---------------------------------

### Initial Assessment

For new suppliers:

1.  **Create Supplier Profile:** Document supplier details and the
    nature of the services provided.

2.  **Risk Assessment:** Conduct an initial risk assessment to evaluate
    potential security risks and compliance considerations.

3.  **Compliance Documentation:** Collect and document compliance
    information, including certifications and audit reports.

4.  **Approval Process:** Obtain approval from the CISO before
    engagement.

5.  **Annual Review:** Review supplier compliance and performance
    annually.

### Ongoing Assessment

-   **Annual Evaluation:** Assess supplier standards and performance
    annually and document findings.

-   **Issue Management:** Address any compliance or performance issues
    promptly and report them to the CISO.

Contractual Requirements
------------------------

### Security Obligations

Contracts with suppliers must include:

-   Clear security and data protection obligations.

-   Requirements for compliance with ISO 27001 where applicable.

-   Clauses for regular security assessments and audits.

-   Provisions for incident reporting and response.

-   Risk appropriate provision of business continuity and disaster
    recovery

### Cloud Services Exit Strategy

To ensure Paythru maintains business continuity, security, and
compliance during cloud service exits or transitions, the following
steps must be performed:

1.  **Preparing for an Exit**

    -   Conduct a detailed impact assessment of affected services and
        dependencies.

    -   Identify all internal and external stakeholders and clarify
        communication requirements.

    -   Review contractual obligations, especially required notice
        periods and data retention requirements.

    -   Establish a formal project timeline with key milestones and
        deliverables.

    -   Assign dedicated personnel responsible for managing the exit
        process and clarify their roles.

2.  **Obtaining Company Data and IPR**

    -   Inventory all data assets and locations stored, processed, or
        managed by the cloud service.

    -   Request a final export of all company data in a
        widely-supported, industry-standard format.

    -   Validate the integrity, completeness, and usability of exported
        data.

    -   Secure all relevant intellectual property (IPR), including
        custom configurations, scripts, and documentation, and ensure
        transfer.

    -   Obtain and archive evidence (written/signed confirmation) that
        the provider has deleted all company data from their systems.

3.  **Finding Equivalent Alternative Services**

    -   Carry out a documented market analysis to identify one or more
        suitable replacement cloud services.

    -   Analyse compatibility with existing in-house systems and ongoing
        business needs.

    -   Check compliance requirements for PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and other
        applicable standards.

    -   Conduct a formal security and risk assessment of short-listed
        providers.

    -   Where feasible, run limited-scope proof-of-concept migrations to
        test alternatives before committing.

    -   Assess the total cost of ownership (TCO), including migration,
        retraining, and potential change management costs.

4.  **Ensuring Contract Compliance**

    -   Review and document completion of all contractual obligations
        and agreed deliverables before contract ends.

    -   Ensure all necessary handover material and procedural
        documentation is complete and transferred.

    -   Close or migrate all outstanding incidents, support tickets, or
        open items with the supplier.

    -   Conduct a post-exit review to document lessons learned for
        future procurement improvements.

    -   Obtain and store all necessary service cessation documentation,
        including final service reports and compliance certificates
        where relevant.

User Access and Authentication
------------------------------

-   **Access Control:** Ensure that supplier access to Paythru's data
    and systems is based on the principle of least privilege.

-   **Authentication:** Use secure authentication methods, including
    multi-factor authentication (MFA), where applicable.

Data Classification and Handling
--------------------------------

-   **Data Classification:** Classify data based on sensitivity and
    implement appropriate controls. This will be recorded generally
    within the risk assigned to a supplier.

-   **Data Handling:** Ensure that suppliers handle data in compliance
    with the Paythru's data protection policies and relevant
    regulations.

Monitoring and Logging
----------------------

-   **Logging:** Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track
    supplier activities and detect security incidents.

-   **Review:** Regularly review logs to identify potential security
    threats and ensure compliance.

AI Tool Usage
-------------

AI Tools are governed by a [separate
policy](https://paythru.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DP/pages/3850436619/AI+Tool+Usage+Policy).
Before an AI tool can be used by the company, it must first go through a
[basic security
assessment](https://paythru.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DP/pages/3850174468/AI+Prompt+Sharing+and+Approved+AI+Tools).

Staff Training and Awareness
----------------------------

-   Provide training to staff on supplier management and information
    security requirements.

-   Ensure suppliers are aware of their security obligations and
    compliance requirements.

Refer to [Paythru Security Awareness
Training](https://paythru.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DP/pages/31916166/Security+Awareness+Training+Policy)
for more information on our training programmes.

Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------

### Executive Management

-   Oversee the procurement process and ensure alignment with
    organisational objectives and compliance requirements.

-   Manage supplier relationships, contracts, and performance
    evaluations.

### CISO

-   Approve supplier engagements, oversee risk assessments, and ensure
    compliance with this policy.

### Users

-   Use supplier services in accordance with this policy and report any
    security concerns promptly.

Incident Response
-----------------

### Reporting

-   Suppliers are required to report any suspected security incidents

for specific steps.

Supplier Performance Rating
---------------------------

Suppliers are assessed and a record is kept as guidance on meeting
deadlines and offering appropriate support. The supplier will then be
rated as either good, bad, or caution. Suppliers with a \'bad\' rating
should be carefully assessed and all risks identified before using them.
Suppliers will be rated \'caution\' where an element of their
deliverables causes concern which could be detrimental to Paythru or
their clients, care is then taken to ensure that all parties are aware
of the risks before committing to the supplier.

Exemption Statement
-------------------

Any exemption to this policy must be approved by the CISO.
