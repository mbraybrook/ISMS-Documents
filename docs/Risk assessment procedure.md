1.  **Scope**

> This method of risk assessment is applied throughout Paythru Ltd in
> respect of information risks.

2.  **Responsibilities**

> The Information Security Manager (CISO) is responsible for carrying
> out risk assessments wherever they are required by the ISMS.

3.  **Procedure**

> **Identify the risks**

1.  The risks to Paythru Ltd's information are identified by discussion
    between the CISO and MD, including consultation of the Board of
    Directors and other business stakeholders (not excluding senior
    management and asset owners as considered appropriate). Risks to
    availability, confidentiality and integrity are documented in the
    risk log.

2.  The effect that losses of availability, confidentiality and
    integrity might have on Paythru Ltd are identified and documented in
    a standard document template available on the corporate intranet.

3.  For each risk, a risk owner is identified and recorded.

4.  **Assess the risks**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  The impact -- the business harm - that might result from the loss of
    availability, confidentiality or integrity, for each of these risks,
    is assessed by discussion between the CISO and MD, including
    consultation of the Board of Directors and other business
    stakeholders (not excluding senior management and asset owners) as
    considered appropriate.

2.  The realistic likelihood that each of these risks might occur is
    assessed by discussion between the CISO and MD, including
    consultation of the Board of Directors and other business
    stakeholders (not excluding senior management and asset owners) as
    considered appropriate.

3.  The risk levels are assessed by discussion between the CISO and MD,
    including consultation of the Board of Directors and other business
    stakeholders (not excluding senior management and asset owners) as
    considered appropriate.

4.  A decision is made, for each of the risks, as to whether it is
    acceptable or if it must be controlled in line with criteria
    established in [Risk
    assessment](https://paythrultd.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Compliance/Shared%20Documents/Paythru%20ISMS/Clauses/Risk%20Assessment.xlsm?d=w29fd042d956945feb12ca964009dd643&csf=1&web=1&e=uTCUvb)
    and [Risk management
    framework](https://paythrultd.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/Compliance/Shared%20Documents/Paythru%20ISMS/Clauses/Risk%20management%20framework.docx?d=w3db6033fdade48e786d93a02e50501e5&csf=1&web=1&e=8yf4Aa)
    as follows:

> **Retain:** This action involves accepting the risk as it is because
> it falls within Paythru\'s risk tolerance or because the cost of
> mitigating the risk outweighs the benefits. Paythru acknowledges the
> risk and decides not to take any further action to change it.
>
> **Modify:** This action entails taking steps to reduce the likelihood
> or impact of a risk to an acceptable level. Modification involves
> implementing controls or changes to processes, systems, or behaviors
> to manage the risk more effectively.
>
> **Share:** This involves transferring the risk to a third party, such
> as through insurance, outsourcing, or partnerships. By sharing the
> risk, paythru reduces its potential impact or likelihood but retains
> partial responsibility depending on the terms of the arrangement.
>
> **Avoid:** This action means eliminating the risk entirely by not
> engaging in the activity or removing the source of the risk. Avoidance
> is chosen when the risk is too high and cannot be mitigated or
> transferred effectively.

5.  **Identify and evaluate options for the treatment of risks**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  For each of the risks, identify the possible options for treating it
    in line with the decision made in 4.4 above.

2.  For each of the risks, document which treatment action (avoid,
    retain, modify, and share) is going to be taken and document in the
    [Risk
    assessment](https://paythrultd.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Compliance/Shared%20Documents/Paythru%20ISMS/Clauses/Risk%20Assessment.xlsm?d=w29fd042d956945feb12ca964009dd643&csf=1&web=1&e=uTCUvb)
    the reasons for each choice.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
6.  **Select control objectives and controls for treatment of the
    risks**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Appropriate control objectives are selected or designed according to
    the specific needs of the risk and the organization and controls to
    achieve those objectives are selected from a variety of sources.

2.  Controls selected in 6.1 above are compared against those from Annex
    A of ISO27002:2022 to ensure that none have been missed.

3.  The final selection of controls and control objectives and the
    reasons for the selections (whether inclusion or exclusion) are
    documented.

4.  These control objectives and controls are then summarised in the
    Statement of Applicability.
